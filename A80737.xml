         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know how to make uſe of this Treatiſe, I ſhall acquaint you</hi> in brief <hi>with the whole</hi> deſigne <hi>thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> firſt part, <hi>I have couched together in</hi> three Chapters <hi>the chief and neceſſary</hi> things <hi>that are to be</hi> known <hi>and</hi> believed <hi>concerning</hi> God, our ſelves, and the Mediator between God and man. <hi>That ſo thoſe that have a mind to know, may (in ſhort) be informed of the</hi> main things <hi>they are ſo</hi> deeply concern'd <hi>to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. And becauſe 'tis of</hi> exceeding great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>that people ſhould well underſtand how</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170311:7"/> the things <hi>they profeſs to</hi> believe <hi>are</hi> grounded <hi>on</hi> Gods Word, <hi>I have collected together</hi> moſt of thoſe Scriptures <hi>that are ſcattered up and down in the Book of God</hi> (upon which the Articles of our Faith are founded) <hi>and have reduced them to</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral heads, <hi>and printed them</hi> at large, <hi>that ſo they may be as</hi> ſeveral conſtellations, <hi>or</hi> cluſters of Stars, <hi>giving you the more light, and clearer aſsurance of the things they are brought to prove. This courſe I have taken alſo in the</hi> ſecond Part, <hi>in reference to the</hi> things <hi>that are to be</hi> practiſed. <hi>My intent herein being, that my Book ſhould fully</hi> inform <hi>you what is Gods</hi> mind <hi>and</hi> revealed will <hi>concerning thoſe particulars I treat of, which may be of</hi> ſingular uſe <hi>to you in ſeveral reſpects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To</hi> ſtrengthen <hi>and</hi> confirm <hi>your own</hi> belief <hi>of the</hi> Articles <hi>of the Chriſtian Faith; to</hi> awe <hi>your</hi> Conſciences <hi>with the</hi> authority <hi>of Gods Word, and to</hi> engage your hearts <hi>to the</hi> practiſe <hi>of thoſe things that ſhall appear to be your duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To</hi> enable <hi>you to</hi> inſtruct <hi>your children and ſervants in the</hi> Principles <hi>of</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> obedience <hi>from the</hi> Scriptures <hi>here ſet down to your hands; which</hi> every one <hi>is not able readily to find out that has not</hi> ſome ſuch help.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To</hi> ſecure <hi>you againſt</hi> Errors <hi>now ſo riſe among us. Seeing you may hereby defend the</hi> Faith once delivered to the Saints, <hi>and confute the enemies of truth, as our</hi> Saviour <hi>did the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>by alledging the</hi> Sacred Scriptures <hi>for the things you</hi> believe <hi>and</hi> practiſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170311:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Second Part <hi>I treat of the things that</hi> concern your practiſe. <hi>And becauſe</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>of our waies, and</hi> examining <hi>the ſtate of our ſouls to God-ward is a matter of ſo exceeding</hi> great uſe, <hi>that ſcarce any thing</hi> undoes <hi>Mankind more than the</hi> neglect <hi>of it, I begin with</hi> that. <hi>And oh that I may prevail with you to a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Practiſe of it. I have heard of a Gentleman that uPon his Death-bed laid this one command up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wild Son, and engag'd him to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it by a ſolemn promiſe,</hi> that he ſhould eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of his life be half an hour alone: <hi>Which this young man conſtantly obſerving, and ſpending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> his half hours retirement <hi>(at first) in any kind of vain thoughts,</hi> at laſt <hi>he began to ponder with himſelf, why his Father ſhould enjoyn him</hi> this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; <hi>and the</hi> Spirit <hi>of God ſuggesting to him, that</hi> his intent <hi>therein could be no other but to bring him to</hi> conſider of his evil waies, <hi>and</hi> whither they tended, <hi>and</hi> what would become of him hereafter if he went on; <hi>it pleaſed the Lord ſo to</hi> ſet thoſe thoughts <hi>home upon his</hi> heart, <hi>that he became a new man: Of ſo much advantage is conſideration, and frequent taking our ſelves in private to think of the ſtate of our ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> three <hi>next Chapters I handle the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of</hi> Repentance, Faith, <hi>and</hi> a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>and</hi> reformed life, <hi>being indeed the</hi> main things <hi>wherein the power and life of Godlineſſe conſiſts. And therefore I intreat you give the
<pb facs="tcp:170311:8"/> more</hi> heed <hi>unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Fifth <hi>Chapter I treat of</hi> maintaining a daily, cloſe communion with God, <hi>and ſhew,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How we ſhould</hi> awake with God <hi>in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo begin the day well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How we ſhould</hi> pour forth our ſouls in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer and thankſgiving <hi>unto him;</hi> private prayer <hi>being every ones duty, and a great</hi> help <hi>to Holineſs. And that people may not be</hi> ſlight <hi>and</hi> formal <hi>in theſe duties, and ſo offend in the</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>of doing them, I give ſome</hi> Directions <hi>for the right performance of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I ſhew how we ſhould</hi> diligently read the Scriptures, <hi>the</hi> Oracles <hi>of God, which are able</hi> (through the operation of the Spirit) to make us wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How we ſhould live continually as in the ſight and view of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. How we ſhould live by Faith, in ten par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="6">6. How we ſhould be diligent obſervers of the Providence of God, <hi>that ſo we may order our ſervices of</hi> prayer and praiſe <hi>accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. How we ſhould practiſe the great duty of daily watchfulneſſe, <hi>continually watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Over our thoughts, <hi>that we lodge not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts in our minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Over our Affections, <hi>that we allow not
<pb facs="tcp:170311:8"/> any ſinful motions, and stirrings in our hearts, but labour ſpeedily to ſuppreſs them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Over our words, <hi>that we offend not (as we are exceeding apt) with our tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Over our actions, <hi>that they may be ſuch as proceed from</hi> a right Principle, <hi>are conform'd to a</hi> right Rule, <hi>and are directed to a</hi> right end. <hi>Theſe are the things we muſt</hi> watch over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next I ſet down what are the</hi> things <hi>we must</hi> watch againſt. <hi>In the general,</hi> all ſin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. <hi>But</hi> in particular,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe ſins we are moſt inclin'd unto by our own temper and naturall conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſins we are moſt expoſed to by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our calling, condition, ſtate and courſe of life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſins of the times and places where we live.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Againſt all occaſions and temptations, that we foreſee are like to endanger our ſouls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Againſt diſhonouring God by the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and undue uſe of lawful things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Againſt Errour; <hi>where the</hi> danger of it <hi>is ſhewed, and ſome</hi> preſervatives <hi>are given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place is ſhewed, how we ſhould</hi> watch for opportunities of doing and receiving good: <hi>And ſome</hi> Motives <hi>to watchfulneſs are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the Chapter ſhut up with</hi> theſe two Directions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170311:9"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That we ſhould beſides our ſolemn prayers, ſend up</hi> frequent, mental, ejaculatory prayers unto the Lord for his Grace, help, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That every night we ſhould retire, and reflect upon all our actions, and whole behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the day paſt, and ſo ſet all at rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and our ſouls before we go to ſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And becauſe, whoever deſires</hi> to grow in Knowledge and Grace, <hi>muſt conſcientiouſly make</hi> uſe of, <hi>and</hi> improve <hi>the</hi> means <hi>of Grace that God affords him, therefore in the</hi> Sixth <hi>Chapter I treat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the careful obſervation of the Lords day. <hi>Shewing</hi> why <hi>we ſhould obſerve it, and</hi> how. <hi>For my part I never ſaw</hi> true Religion <hi>and the</hi> power of Godlineſſe <hi>thrive in any</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, family, <hi>or</hi> Pariſh, <hi>where the</hi> religious <hi>and</hi> conſcientious <hi>obſervance of</hi> that day <hi>was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing the Word; <hi>where</hi> directions <hi>are given;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. How we are to prepare our ſelves before we go to hear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How we are to behave our ſelves in time of hearing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What we are to do after we have heard. <hi>And oh that I might</hi> prevail <hi>with you to read theſe</hi> Directions <hi>often (eſpecially on</hi> Saturday-nights)
<pb facs="tcp:170311:9"/> 
               <hi>that ſo you might come</hi> prepared. <hi>The great</hi> reaſon <hi>of the</hi> unprofitableneſſe <hi>of preaching, and that</hi> Sermons <hi>do no</hi> more <hi>good, is, becauſe people come without</hi> preparation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Seeing that Heavenly duty of</hi> ſinging Pſalms <hi>and</hi> lifting up the praiſes of the moſt High, <hi>is now by ſome</hi> queſtion'd <hi>(as indeed what is not that tends to Gods Glory and mans good?) I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely handle that</hi> ſubject, <hi>and</hi> prove it to be a duty under the Goſpel, anſwer the Objections againſt it, <hi>and</hi> give ſome Directions for the right performing of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Foraſmuch as Chriſtians might exceedingly</hi> benefit one another <hi>by</hi> Religious conference; <hi>thereby</hi> warming <hi>and</hi> enlivening <hi>one another, and</hi> provoking <hi>one another to</hi> love <hi>and to</hi> good works,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place I ſpeak of</hi> that duty, <hi>and ſet down</hi> ſome Rules <hi>concerning it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, Becauſe</hi> without meditation <hi>'tis not to be expected the Word ſhould</hi> do much good, <hi>nor that the ſoul ſhould ever</hi> thrive in Knowledge and Grace, <hi>I ſhew the</hi> excellency <hi>and</hi> benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>and give ſome</hi> Directions <hi>for the practiſe of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Seventh <hi>Chapter treats of the</hi> danger <hi>of</hi> frequenting, <hi>and</hi> unneceſſarily converſing with bad company, <hi>whereby many have been everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly undone. A man that prayes to be delivered</hi> from temptations, <hi>muſt not wilfully</hi> run himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:170311:10"/> into them. <hi>And becauſe 'tis the duty of all true Chriſtians both for their</hi> own peace ſake, <hi>and that they may</hi> adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>to ſerve their generation in ſome</hi> honeſt <hi>and</hi> commendable way (avoiding Idleneſſe, that great ſnare of the Devil.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> eighth <hi>Chapter I diſcourſe of</hi> diligence <hi>and</hi> conſcientiouſneſſe in our particular places and callings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that the</hi> Name of God <hi>may not be</hi> blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed <hi>by the</hi> ill lives <hi>and</hi> practiſes <hi>of ſuch as</hi> profeſſe <hi>themſelves Chriſtians;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Ninth <hi>Chapter I treat</hi> of juſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right dealing in Trading and Commerce, <hi>giving ſome</hi> Rules <hi>both to</hi> buyers <hi>and</hi> ſellers, <hi>and ſhew</hi> the neceſſity of <hi>making</hi> reſtitution of, <hi>or</hi> ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for ill gotten goods.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> Tenth <hi>Chapter contains the</hi> duties <hi>of</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Families, <hi>which I deſire all that are in</hi> that relation <hi>often to</hi> read <hi>over, and ſeriouſly to</hi> meditate <hi>upon.

But through their</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>of the Worſhip of God in their houſes, and their</hi> ill lives <hi>and</hi> examples <hi>they prove too often</hi> an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>of the ruine of many in their Families.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the</hi> Sixteenth <hi>Chapter I treat of that</hi> great <hi>and</hi> hard duty <hi>of</hi> Chriſtian reproof and admonition, <hi>which if it were</hi> prudently <hi>and</hi> faithfully <hi>diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, would (by the bleſſing of God) much</hi> abate ſin <hi>in the world, and exceedingly</hi> advance Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Seventeenth <hi>Chapter contains the</hi> duties of rich <hi>and</hi> poor. <hi>Many</hi> duties <hi>belong to them</hi> both; <hi>and</hi> both <hi>have</hi> great temptations, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had need be careful to</hi> diſcharge <hi>the one, and</hi> avoid <hi>the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Eighteenth <hi>Chapter ſpeaks of the</hi> duties <hi>of</hi> Young <hi>and</hi> Old. <hi>Miniſters find</hi> by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>that the</hi> Word <hi>hath the</hi> greateſt operation <hi>on thoſe that are</hi> young, <hi>who have not</hi> contracted

I have therefore ſhewed</hi> young perſons <hi>the</hi> danger of delaies, <hi>the</hi> advantages of turning to God betimes, <hi>and</hi> anſwered the Objections that many are apt to make againſt it. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a</hi> Miniſter <hi>is alſo to have a care of the</hi> ſouls <hi>of the</hi> Ancient, <hi>and (to his utmost skill) to</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their ſalvation, <hi>I have laid down</hi> ſeveral awakening conſiderations <hi>for them to think upon, I have ſhewed them the</hi> danger of vain preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and groundleſſe hopes <hi>of Heaven.

               <hi>In the</hi> Nineteenth <hi>Chapter there are</hi> Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given for the healthy and the ſick. <hi>To deal</hi> wiſely and faithfully <hi>with</hi> ſick <hi>perſons</hi> in order to their ſouls welfare, <hi>is one of the</hi> hardeſt <hi>pieces of the Miniſterial work, and requires</hi> much skill <hi>to perform it aright.

               <hi>The</hi> Twentieth <hi>Chapter contains a</hi> diſcourſe <hi>of the</hi> four laſt things, Death, Judgment, Hell, Heaven. <hi>There I ſhew the neceſſity of</hi> Learning <hi>(even in time of health)</hi> that great art and skill, how to die well. <hi>Next,</hi> what the Scripture declares concerning the day of judgment, <hi>and</hi> the everlaſting ſtate both of the righteous and the wicked: <hi>And methinks the</hi> ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>of theſe</hi> weighty matters, <hi>ſhould hugely affect us. O did people oftener think and conſider of</hi> thoſe things, <hi>they would live</hi> at another rate <hi>than uſually they do. All the buſineſſes of this life would ſeem</hi> ſmall <hi>and</hi> little <hi>(even like childrens play) in</hi> compariſon <hi>of ſecuring the ſoul to all eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> (My Loving Neighbours and Friends) <hi>I have given you a</hi> ſhort draught and ſcheme <hi>(as it were) of my whole Book. What</hi> entertainment <hi>it will find with you, I know not. I can in ſome meaſure of ſincerity ſay, that an</hi> hearty deſire <hi>of your eternal happineſs first ſet me upon this work. And now (throw the aſſiſtance of God) it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, my</hi> prayers <hi>ſhall not be wanting that it may do you</hi> good, <hi>yea,</hi> much good. <hi>If any of you will not</hi> afford leiſure to read it, <hi>nor</hi> time to conſider of the things therein contained, <hi>but after you have had it a little while, ſhall</hi> throw it aſide, <hi>then I deſire you ſeriouſly to</hi> think before hand, <hi>what account you will be able to give to God of this your</hi> wilful neglect, <hi>when you ſhall ſtand at his
<pb facs="tcp:170311:12"/> dreadful Tribunal. For my part, I have no</hi> other deſign <hi>upon</hi> any of you, <hi>but that you may attain eternal life. My</hi> great deſire <hi>is that</hi> true Plety <hi>and</hi> Godlineſſe, <hi>that</hi> that Religion that ſaves ſouls <hi>may flouriſh among you. My deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is that where the</hi> ſaving work of Grace is begun <hi>upon any of your hearts;</hi> it may be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on daily, <hi>and that you may</hi> encreaſe <hi>and</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more and more in the fruits of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, to the praiſe and glory of God. <hi>And where this</hi> bleſſed work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion <hi>is not yet</hi> begun, <hi>my</hi> hearts deſire and prayer to God is <hi>that it may be wrought, if it be his holy will. You ſee the</hi> plot <hi>and</hi> deſign <hi>I have upon you is of</hi> ſo innocent a nature, <hi>that you have no reaſon in the world to go about to</hi> defeat <hi>me in it. 'Tis my duty to ſhew ſinners the</hi> evil <hi>and</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>of</hi> ignorance and ungodlineſſe. <hi>'Tis my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to</hi> perſwade, intreat, <hi>and be</hi> earneſt <hi>with them to leave the</hi> tents of ſin and Satan, <hi>and to</hi> come in to Chriſt, <hi>that</hi> by him <hi>they may have</hi> pardon <hi>and</hi> life, And O that I could even compel them to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. <hi>Were it in my power, not a ſoul among you ſhould refuſe or ſtand out. But if (notwithſtanding all my prayers, intreaties, and endeavours) many among you will ſtill prefer a</hi> life of bruitiſh ſenſuality, <hi>before the</hi> life that conſiſts in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt: <hi>If Satan</hi> that curſed murderer (<hi>who you know</hi> labours to ruine you ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:170311:13"/> for ever) <hi>must ſtill be preferr'd before that</hi> bleſſed Saviour, <hi>who</hi> ſuffered <hi>and</hi> endur'd <hi>ſo much to</hi> redeem mankind, <hi>and</hi> offers you ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on ſo fair terms: <hi>If neither the</hi> joyes <hi>of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor the</hi> torments <hi>of Hell can affect you, but the</hi> pleaſures <hi>and</hi> profits <hi>of this world muſt ſtill</hi> ingroſſe your minds and hearts; <hi>remember what I ſay unto you,</hi> it will one day cut you to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul to conſider <hi>that you were</hi> ſhewed the way to eternal life, <hi>and</hi> invited, perſwaded <hi>and</hi> intreated <hi>to walk in it, but</hi> you would not. <hi>O Neighbours,</hi> think with your ſelves <hi>(I beſeech you) that</hi> 'tis but a ſhort time, <hi>and</hi> your ſouls <hi>muſt be either</hi> among Saints or Devils. <hi>Does it not concern me therefore to be</hi> earneſt <hi>with you, and in</hi> all ſeriouſneſſe <hi>to call upon you,</hi> to work out your ſalvation, now while you have time? <hi>For the Lords ſake, as ever you intend to ſee Gods face with comfort,</hi> remember theſe few following directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of a looſe converſation, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof. If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. Which are theſe, Adultery, fornication, uncleanneſſe, lalciviouſneſſe, idolatry, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings, murders, drunkenneſſe, and ſuch like: Of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in time paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit
<pb facs="tcp:170311:13"/> the Kingdom of God. <hi>Never comfort your ſelves with the hopes of</hi> Gods mercy in Chriſt, <hi>if ye live in</hi> known <hi>and</hi> wilful <hi>ſins. The</hi> holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>of God will never be</hi> reconciled <hi>to ſinners, while they</hi> go on <hi>in their ſins. And Christ came</hi> to deſtroy the works of the Devil. <hi>He came not to ſave men,</hi> by bringing them to Heaven in their ungodlineſſe, <hi>or</hi> to Glory in their ſins, <hi>but</hi> to deſtroy their ſins, <hi>that would keep them out of Glory. If he ſave us,</hi> his Grace muſt have dominion in our hearts. Without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed of worldly-mindedneſſe. <hi>I do not go about to perſwade you to</hi> idleneſſe <hi>or</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in your Callings, <hi>but to</hi> take you off <hi>from the</hi> eager <hi>and</hi> inordinate love <hi>of this world, which</hi> duls <hi>and</hi> deads <hi>the heart to</hi> Heavenly things. <hi>Beware</hi> leſt ye be the thorny ground. <hi>Look to it, that the</hi> cares of this life do not choak the good ſeed that is weekly ſown among you. <hi>Some people</hi> give up <hi>themſelves</hi> wholly <hi>to the world, and thruſt</hi> God <hi>out of their</hi> hearts <hi>and</hi> houſes; <hi>Take you heed of</hi> that. <hi>Believe it,</hi> that man <hi>that hath the</hi> main bent <hi>of his heart ſet upon</hi> pleaſing God, <hi>and whoſe</hi> great end <hi>is to be</hi> happy with him for ever, <hi>will be careful only</hi> ſo to converſe with this world, <hi>and only ſo</hi> to mind things temporal, <hi>as he may not</hi> loſe things eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. <hi>He will</hi> firſt <hi>and</hi> chiefly ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſſe. <hi>He will look
<pb facs="tcp:170311:14"/> upon</hi> all outwartd things <hi>as</hi> accomodations <hi>only in his</hi> paſſage, <hi>but</hi> at Heaven <hi>as his</hi> home <hi>and</hi> happineſſe. <hi>He will cordially deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to walk in his</hi> particular Calling, <hi>as he may be</hi> faithful alſo in his general, <hi>and may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his ſoul to eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Be careful to get a diſtinct <hi>and</hi> clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things that concern your ſalvation. <hi>Ignorance will not</hi> excuſe <hi>any man when 'tis cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by his own negligence. <hi>The</hi> main things <hi>that concern ſalvation, you may know, if you will give your minds to it. God hath not left you in darkneſſe, take heed of ſhutting your eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Take heed of neglecting or ſlighting the publick Ordinances, and means of Grace. <hi>To have</hi> no appetite <hi>to the Word, to apprehend</hi> no great need <hi>of it, and to find</hi> no profit by it, <hi>is a mark of a</hi> dead <hi>and</hi> graceleſſe heart.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take heed of formality and reſting in a meer outward performance of religious ſervices. <hi>Learn to diſtinguiſh between</hi> Religion the end, <hi>and</hi> Religion the means. Religion the end <hi>is,</hi> To attain a gracious frame of Spirit, to enjoy God, to fear him, love him, and have our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conform'd unto him. Religion the means <hi>is,</hi> to perform ſuch religions duties and ſervices as God hath appointed for the attaining this end. <hi>Now if we</hi> reſt in the means, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of religious duties, <hi>without deſiring</hi> to enjoy God in them, <hi>or labouring</hi> to get our
<pb facs="tcp:170311:14"/> hearts into a better frame by them, <hi>and</hi> aiming at thoſe higher ends to which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>our ſervices are rather a</hi> mocking of God, <hi>than a</hi> true <hi>and</hi> ſincere worſhipping of him. <hi>It will do us no good to be of the</hi> right Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>as to</hi> external profeſſion, <hi>if we be</hi> ſlight, <hi>and</hi> formal, <hi>and</hi> perfunctory in the duties of that Religion. <hi>Take heed therefore of having only</hi> a form of Godlineſſe, <hi>and</hi> denying, <hi>or</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly hating the power thereof. <hi>What will it profit any man to be</hi> thought godly <hi>and</hi> religious, <hi>if God know him to be</hi> ungodly? <hi>Our Saviour hath told us</hi> that except our righteouſneſs exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees <hi>(and yet theirs was outwardly a very ſtrict religiouſneſs)</hi> we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Take heed of contenting your ſelves with meer civil honeſty, <hi>and</hi> a fair, juſt outward converſation. <hi>This is very</hi> commendable, <hi>yea and</hi> neceſſary, <hi>but this is not</hi> ſufficient <hi>to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Without</hi> regeneration <hi>and</hi> true converſion <hi>there is no ſalvation to be expected. Not only</hi> looſe livers, <hi>but</hi> meer civil perſons <hi>need a</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change. <hi>There are many people that</hi> applaud <hi>themſelves in their own righteouſneſſe;</hi> they give every one their own; they defraud no man; they pay what they owe to all men. <hi>Do they ſo? I am glad of it. But let us a little examine whether they be ſo</hi> juſt <hi>as they pretend. Poſſibly they give</hi> every man <hi>his due, and would not</hi> defraud
<pb facs="tcp:170311:15"/> 
               <hi>any man</hi> willingly <hi>or</hi> knowingly <hi>of any thing. I commend them for it, But do they give</hi> God <hi>his</hi> due? <hi>They owe</hi> their hearts <hi>to him: They owe</hi> ſincere obedience <hi>and</hi> ſpiritual worſhip <hi>to him: They are bound to</hi> love him above all, <hi>and</hi> delight in communion with him, <hi>and</hi> to make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the duties <hi>and</hi> ſervices he requires. They ought to fear and reverence his holy Name, to delight in his Word, to ſanctifie his day, to attend upon his Ordinances, to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his honour, to decline all waies of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt him, either by wicked thoughts, irregular affections, ſinful words, evil actions. Their whole life ought to be a living unto God, and his Glory ought to be their end and aim in all their undertakings. They ought to renounce the devil, the world and the fleſh, and to ſerve him faithfully all their daies. <hi>Now then come, and let us conſider, Do they do thus? Do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give every one his</hi> own? <hi>Do they give unto</hi> God, <hi>what of right is</hi> due <hi>unto</hi> him? <hi>They make Conſcience of being</hi> juſt <hi>towards</hi> men <hi>(and they do well in it) but are they careful alſo of</hi> paying God <hi>what they owe to</hi> him? <hi>And what kind of</hi> righteouſneſſe <hi>call you this, to be righteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> men, <hi>and unrighteous and</hi> unjuſt <hi>toward</hi> God? <hi>Is this a</hi> righteouſneſſe <hi>any man dare</hi> ſtand upon, <hi>and</hi> plead <hi>for his juſtification before Gods Tribunal? You ſee then there is more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than an</hi> honeſt, outward, fair converſation <hi>to ſave the ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170311:15"/>
            <p n="7">7. Take heed of deceiving and ill-grounded hopes of Heaven. <hi>Secure your</hi> ſtate in Grace, <hi>and then your</hi> title to Glory <hi>is unqueſtionable. Look to your</hi> evidences <hi>for Heaven. Take heed of</hi> miſtakes <hi>about the great work of</hi> repenting <hi>and</hi> believing in Chriſt. <hi>Many think they</hi> have thoſe Graces, <hi>when indeed they</hi> have only a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of them. Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith: Prove your ſelves. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Chriſt is a new Creature; old things are paſſed away, <hi>old</hi> carnal principles, <hi>old</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inclinations, <hi>old</hi> wicked practiſes, <hi>old</hi> ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly company <hi>are</hi> paſſed away <hi>and left by them that are</hi> true converts. <hi>Ask your ſelves</hi> whether your repentance be a repentance unto life? whether your Faith be a ſaving Faith? <hi>What the</hi> true characters <hi>of</hi> Repentance <hi>and</hi> Faith <hi>are, you may find in the</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>and</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Chapters of the</hi> ſecond Part <hi>of this Treatiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis</hi> carnal hopes <hi>that</hi> deceive <hi>the world, and hinder people from looking after a ſaving converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Content not your ſelves therefore to ſay,</hi> you hope you ſhall be ſaved, <hi>but</hi> prove <hi>and</hi> try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are ſuch perſons as God hath promiſed ſalvation to. <hi>Prove by</hi> marks of Grace <hi>in your ſouls that you are</hi> true converts, <hi>and then</hi> hope <hi>for ſalvation, and ſpare not, and the Lord</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>your hopes. Great things and of everlaſting conſequence, ſhould be made as ſure as is poſsible. Ask your ſelves what</hi> evidences <hi>you have you are
<pb facs="tcp:170311:16"/> converted. 'Tis</hi> proof <hi>muſt carry it, and not</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident preſumption. Take God in Chriſt for your only happineſſe and end: And Chriſt as Mediatour, for your only Lord and Saviour. Accept him for your Sovereign, as well as for your Saviour. Be ſenſible of your continual need of his Bloud, Spirit and interceſſion, and give up your ſelves ſincerely to him, to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, ſanctified, guided, directed and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly ſaved by him. Let his Intereſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in your ſouls, and you are bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Pray earneſtly unto the Lord to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the truth, and to be preſerved from Errour, giddineſſe, and apoſtacy, which is the ſin and ſhame of theſe times. <hi>Let not the</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions <hi>that are now going, be an</hi> offence <hi>unto you. Remember that though</hi> men are muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>and change from one opinion to another, and grow</hi> wanton <hi>and</hi> wild-headed, <hi>yet</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the</hi> Scripture, <hi>and</hi> Heaven, <hi>and</hi> the way thither, are ſtill the ſame: Theſe change not: Mind you theſe things. <hi>Take heed of that</hi> threefold Apoſtacy <hi>that this age is</hi> too guilty of. <hi>Namely,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Judgment, <hi>from the Truths of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of Affection, <hi>from the Ordinances of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Of Converſation, <hi>from that ſober, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and circumſpect walking, which all true
<pb facs="tcp:170311:16"/> Chriſtians ſhould make Conſcience of. Let not the</hi> treachery of falſe brethren <hi>diſhearten you: He is the</hi> right Souldier <hi>that is not diſcouraged by thoſe that</hi> run away, <hi>but ſtill preſſeth on to victory. In a word, lay not out your zeal on</hi> externals, <hi>or</hi> opinions <hi>and the</hi> ſmaller matters <hi>of Religion. Look to it, that there be in you an</hi> unfeigned <hi>and</hi> fervent love to God, his Truth and children: <hi>Let moſt of your daily care be about the right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing of your hearts and affections: Labour to mortifie luſts, and advance Grace. To conclude this,</hi> ſeparate ſpeedily from the ſins of Chriſtians, but never from the Ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Count thoſe your beſt friends that loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully admoniſh you of any ſin or evil they ſee you going on in. <hi>If you were going ignorantly into a houſe infected with the plague, you would think that man your friend that pluckt you back, and acquainted you with your danger. What a</hi> madneſſe <hi>then is it for any man to be offended and angry with him, that out of</hi> true good will <hi>and</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>to his ſoul, deſires to preſerve him from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perdition. Can it be thought by any ſober man a malicious thing to endeavour to ſave a ſoul from ſin and Hell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Take heed of prejudices againſt a ſtrict and holy walking with God, <hi>The Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you from that</hi> mad opinion <hi>of the world, that</hi> like not ſerving God ſo much, nor making ſo
<pb facs="tcp:170311:17"/> much ado to be ſaved. <hi>Conſider is there any thing in the world doth better deſerve your</hi> care <hi>and</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <hi>and will better pay you for it? I know car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal people think the</hi> way <hi>of Religion a</hi> melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>and</hi> ſad <hi>way; But I must not ſpare to tell them the truth; They will never live</hi> a truly ſafe, peaceable and comfortable life, till they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and have engaged their hearts in an humble, holy walking with God. <hi>They ignorantly flee from</hi> Godlineſſe <hi>as from</hi> ſorrow <hi>and</hi> trouble, <hi>but the truth is, they flee from</hi> joy <hi>and</hi> peace. <hi>What ſhould trouble</hi> that man <hi>that is a</hi> member of Chriſt, <hi>and has eſcaped out of the</hi> power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>and is freed from the</hi> wrath of God, <hi>and the danger of everlaſting miſery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> Neighbours! <hi>let not the</hi> ignorant ſcorns <hi>and</hi> ſenſeleſſe reproaches <hi>of wicked men diſcourage you. He that hath</hi> good grounds <hi>to believe that he ſhall live</hi> for ever in Glory With God <hi>and</hi> his holy Angels <hi>as ſoon as his ſoul parts from his body, I think is</hi> a happy man, <hi>and ſo will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by every one that has not</hi> loſt his reaſon and underſtanding. <hi>There is a time coming when the</hi> proudeſt <hi>and</hi> moſt ſtubborn ſinner <hi>will be glad to change condition with the</hi> meaneſt Saint. <hi>Let me therefore intreat</hi> all thoſe <hi>that have</hi> entertain'd any hard thoughts of the waies of Godlineſſe, <hi>but to</hi> make triall <hi>what a holy life is; and if they do not find</hi> more comfort <hi>in a</hi> ſerious turning unto God, <hi>and in</hi> a ſincere endeavour to approve
<pb facs="tcp:170311:17"/> their hearts <hi>unto him, then in the</hi> waies of ſin, <hi>let them take their courſe,</hi> let Heaven go.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Nouriſh and maintain a tenderneſſe of Conſcience: <hi>Be very</hi> circumſpect <hi>in your daily walking. Look upon</hi> ſin <hi>as the</hi> greateſt evil. Make up every breach between God and your ſouls betimes. <hi>Pray earneſtly for the guidance of the Spirit of God, and to be kept from</hi> Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Have a care of your Families, that true Piety and Godlineſſe may be countenanced, encouraged and promoted in them. <hi>Let your houſes be</hi> Bethels, <hi>houſes of God, and not</hi> Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avens, <hi>houſes of iniquity.

            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Labour to maintain peace and love among your ſelves, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.50. — Have ſalt in your ſelves, and peace one with another. <hi>Labour to get your hearts</hi> ſeaſoned <hi>with the</hi> graces
<pb facs="tcp:170311:18"/> of humility, ſelf-denial, <hi>and</hi> true Charity, <hi>and this will keep you in peace among your ſelves. Let there be</hi> no heart-burnings, contentions, brawlings, backbitings <hi>or</hi> defamings <hi>heard of among you.</hi> Help one another on towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Imitate that which is good wherever you find it, but learn evil of no man. Encourage one another in the waies of Godlineſſe. Abhor to draw or intice one another to any ſinfull courſe or practiſe. Do all offices of kindneſſe <hi>and</hi> humanity one for another. As you have opportunity, let it be your deſire and endeavour to do good to every body, hurt to no body. Learn that hard leſſon of forgiving wrongs and injuries, and praying for, and wiſhing well to thoſe that are your enemies. 'Tis a hard leſſon, but Gods Spirit can teach it you. Remember our Saviours Words <hi>in</hi> Matth. 6.14, 15. For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will alſo forgive you.

What is here agreeable to thy holy Will, write upon their hearts. O let it not be in vain that this help is afforded them.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in humane bodies, ſome parts are vital, others only integrall, ſome neceſſary to the being, others to the well being, integrity, and beauty of them: So it is in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Doctrines, ſome are more fundamental, and immediatly neceſſary to life and Godlineſs; others ſuch as do greatly accompliſh and adorn Chriſtians that have attained unto them, and are of ſingular uſe for the edification of the Church, though not ſo primarily belonging to the very vitals and eſſentials of Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe multitudes of ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, either through the exigence of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings, or through the narrowneſſe of their capacities, want both time and ſtrength to procure ſuch plentiful meaſures of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as many others, whoſe leiſure is greater,
<pb facs="tcp:170311:20"/> and intellectuals ſtronger, have attained unto: Therefore the Lord hath from time to time ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up zealous and faithful men to commit unto writing thoſe primary and moſt neceſſary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> which are <hi>common to great and ſmal,</hi> and of principal uſe for orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their converſations aright in every relation wherein they ſtand towards God and men.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort were <hi>Baſil</hi>'s <hi>Moralia &amp; Regulae, Ambroſe</hi> his Book <hi>De officiis, Auguſtin</hi>'s <hi>Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion, Bernards</hi> Tractats <hi>De interiore domo, De Conſcientia, De ordine vitae, De Dilectione Dei, De modo bene vivendi,</hi> and other the like writings of the Ancients.</p>
            <p>Amongſt our ſelves in this age, ſeveral Books of this nature have been written. Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> his ſeven Treatiſes, Mr. <hi>Paul Baine</hi> his Directions for a godly life, Mr. <hi>John Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his Guide to Godlineſſe and Chriſtian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. The Practiſe of Piety, Mr. <hi>Scuddars</hi> Chriſtians daily walk, Mr. <hi>Boltons</hi> Directions for comfortable walking with God, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of the ſame kind. Of which ſome poſſibly may be of too great a price for every poor man to procure, and too large for him to read quickly over. However, the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials managed by the different gifts of ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſtruments, and preſſed by new Arguments and Motives, do bring to the Conſcience a fuller evidence, and awaken the heart unto a
<pb facs="tcp:170311:20"/> more ſerious conſideration of the importance of them.</p>
            <p>Amongſt Books of this Nature, I commend unto the Chriſtian Reader this Manual, which I have read with great ſatisfaction and delight. It hath many things to render it acceptable to ſuch judicious Palats as are beſt pleaſed with ſavoury and ſerious things. 1. The variety and neceſſity of the matters therein handled: Such as are ſelf-knowledge and examination: Repentance and ſelf-judging, living by Faith; watchfulneſſe over our hearts, words, and waies: communion with God in ſpiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; faithfulneſſe in our particular callings and relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The pertinency of the Scriptures produced for confirmation of the Truths which they refer unto. 3. The graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſavourineſſe, and wholſomneſſe of the Language, becoming the weight and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the matter. 4. The ſtrength of the Arguments whereby the duties are preſſed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Brevity of the whole, which rendreth it the fitter for memory, meditation, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: In all which the Reverend Author hath ſhewed himſelfe a workman, which needeth not to be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Some Learned men have choſen ſome one or other Book, which they have reſolved to read over once every year. I could wiſh that ſerious Chriſtians would ſingle out ſome one
<pb facs="tcp:170311:21"/> or other choice Book, fraught with variety of moſt wholſom and neceſſary Doctrine to read frequently over, for daily quickning and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their hearts in an healthy and ſpirituall frame. Of which ſort I ſhould commend, 1. Summaries and Compendiums of ſound Doctrine, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Crooks</hi> guide to true bleſſedneſſe, and others of that ſort. 2. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries of the moſt weighty and neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: A mixture of both which we have in this little Book. By this means, with Gods bleſſing, the hearts of men might be eſtabliſhed in the love and obedience of the Truth, and be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from being toſſed about with every wind of Doctrine, the great ſin and ſhame of theſe daies.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170311:27"/> Creatures therein, (both viſible, and inviſible,) by his Almighty power, and Created them all very good.</p>

                  <p>As God Created the World, and all the Creatures therein by his Almighty Power, So he upholds, directs, diſpoſes, and governs them all by his Providence. Nothing ſo Caſual, but he diſpoſes of it; No Agent ſo free, as to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from his Controule; No affliction or Evil of Puniſhment, but he hath a hand in it; But as for ſin, he neither is, nor poſſibly can be the Author, or Approver of it.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. The Holy and happy eſtate in which God created man at firſt, Namely, after his own Image, in Knowledge, Holineſſe, and Righteouſneſſe, with Dominion over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here below, writing his Law on mans heart, requiring perfect obedience from him, and giving him power to perform it, promiſing the continuance of him in that happy eſtate if he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and threatning him with death if he diſobeyed; <hi>which is called the Covenant of works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The miſerable Condition into which man threw himſelf by ſin: Our firſt Parents (by the temptation of Sathan) diſobeyed God, broke his righteous Law and Commandement; and thereby caſt themſelves out of the Favour of God, became the Slaves of Satan, and liable to the curſe of the Law, and brought a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of ſoul and body upon themſelves; And ſuch as our firſt Parents were, ſuch muſt
<pb facs="tcp:170311:28"/> their poſterity needs be: For <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean,</hi> ſays <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 14.4.</p>
                  <p>They having loſt the Image of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the holineſſe and happineſſe in which they were made, could not conveigh it to their poſterity. So that the nature of man is now become corrupt, prone to evil, backward to good. And this miſerable condition is derived to us from <hi>Adam</hi> by our immediate Parents; and as men come to be born in ſeveral Ages, and generations, ſo they actually participate of the ſap that comes from the firſt root; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore all of us in ſo bad a Condition by nature, and by cuſtome and practice in ſin ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made our ſelves much worſe, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable in the ſight of God, more guilty and liable to his wrath; we are to know and conſider that this woful ſtate of ſin and miſery is by no means to be reſted in; But ſeeing we are fallen into ſo lamentable a condition, we muſt ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to get out of it. And therefore let us remember that without Converſion there is no hope of Salvation; <hi>Except a man be born again, and made a new Creature, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The bleſſed way found out and appointed by God for mans Recovery out of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate, which is by the undertaking and mediation of his onely Son.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. What manner of perſon he was; He was God and Man in the ſame perſon. The Eternal Son of God, The ſecond Perſon in the Trinity took to himſelf our humane Nature (a humane ſoul and body) and united it after a wonderfull manner to his Godhead; And ſo God and Man became one perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How he became man; He was born (about ſixteen hundred and odd years ago) of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> who was of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Scriptures, being Conceived in her by the Almighty power of the Holy Ghoſt, without the help of man, and without ſin; and was Called Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How he Lived; He Lived about three and thirty years here upon Earth, a moſt holy, innocent, ſinleſs Life, performing perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God. And as the <hi>great Prophet</hi> of God (who was promiſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 3, 22.) he declared his Fathers will
<pb facs="tcp:170311:29"/> in his heavenly diſcourſes, and Sermons, and wrought many miracles to confirm his doctrine, and to prove himſelf the true Meſſias, and the Eternal Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How he Died; Being betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> forſaken by his Diſciples, ſcorned and rejected by the World, through the malicious proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, and unjuſt ſentence of <hi>Pilat,</hi> he was Condemned to be Crucified; and being tormented by his perſecutors, and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Terrors of Death, and felt and born Gods wrath; He endured the painful, ſhameful, and curſed death of the Croſſe; there <hi>as a Prieſt</hi> offering up himſelf a Sacrifice to God, and a Ranſome and Propitiation for our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What became of him after his Death; He being buried, roſe again the third day, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fourty days continuance on the earth (in which time he frequently appeared to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and others, teaching the things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Kingdome of God,) he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, and is now in Glory with the Father, where he intercedes for, and preſents the Merits of his Death and Sufferings, in the behalf of all them that unfeignedly repent of their ſins, and do truly beleeve on him. And being made <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of his Church, and Lord of Angels and Men, he ſhall come from Heaven again in great Glory, to judge the quick and the dead at the Laſt day.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:170311:29"/>
                  <p n="6">6. What was the End and Intent of Chriſts Coming into the world. The chief End and Intent of his Coming into the world was to ſave Loſt and undone ſinners, to procure their pardon &amp; reconciliation with God by his Merits; &amp; to Sanctifie their Natures by his Holy Spirit; and to bring them to everlaſting Life. And to this end he appointed his Miniſters to preach the Goſpel unto the world, and inſtituted the two Sacraments, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> to ſignifie and keep in remembrance the great and ineſtimable benefits of his Death and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What they are effectually Called unto, and through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform, that ſhall receive Remiſſion of ſins by Chriſt: They that ſhall be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that great and ineſtimable benefit, the Remiſſion of all their ſins by Chriſt, are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called and enabled by the aſſiſtance of his Grace, unfeignedly to believe the Goſpel, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to repent of all their ſins, ſeriouſly to give up their ſouls unto him, reſting and relying on the Redemption and Ranſome of his Blood for their Pardon and Reconciliation with God. And taking him for their onely Lord &amp; Saviour, and yielding themſelves up in ſincere obedience to him, and to be guided and governed by his Grace and Holy Spirit; they do depend on him alone for Juſtification, Sanctification, ſtrength
<pb facs="tcp:170311:30"/> to perſevere in the ways of Holineſſe, and at laſt to be brought to eternall Life. And to as many as are thus drawn by the Holy Ghoſt ſavingly to repent of their ſins, and believe in Chriſt, being truly united to him, and made branches in him the true Vine, and members of his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body the true Church, (whereof himſelf is the Head,) God hath promiſed pardon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all their ſins, to write his Law in their Hearts, to ſubdue their Corruptions by his Grace, that ſin ſhall not have Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, to beſtow on them all ſuch outward bleſſings as he in his infinite wiſdome ſhall ſee good for them; And when they die, their ſouls ſhall be received into everlaſting bliſſe, and their bodies ſhall be raiſed again by the power of Chriſt at the laſt day, and made partakers of the ſame Glory. <hi>And this is Called the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi> But ſuch as go on in their ſins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to accept of Chriſt, for their Lord and Saviour, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and to give up themſelves in ſincere obedience to him; when they die, their Souls ſhall be adjudged to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment; and their bodies ſhall be raiſed again at the laſt day, and made partakers with their Souls of Everlaſting Torments.</p>

Ask thy ſelf theſe two ſerious Queſtions:</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:170311:96"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is it thy heart is moſt ſet upon? What is thy great care, thy main deſigne? What is it that doth moſt deeply and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently poſſeſſe thy thoughts? What is it that thou doſt moſt love, and prize? and moſt deſire to enjoy? Is thy mind ſo ſpiritually inlightened as to ſee the lovelineſſe of God, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and excellency of that Glory, that is to be had with him? ſo as the main drift and bent of thy heart, is after the enjoyment of God, and to be happy with him forever? Or doſt thou find, that the main bent of thy heart is to the things of this World, to the Profits, the Pleaſures, the ſenſual ſatisfactions of this life; and theſe things thou moſt mindeſt, regardeſt, and laboureſt for; theſe thy thoughts, and heart moſt run upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ask thy ſelf, whether ever thou didſt feel, and apprehend thy ſelf in a loſt, and undone condition by reaſon of thy ſins? Haſt thou not ſeen thy ſelfe in danger of everlaſting miſery? Haſt thou ever put this ſerious queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thy ſelfe, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Haſt thou in this or the like manner ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with thy ſelf?</p>
               <p>O my ſoul, how ſtands the caſe with me? What am I? Am I a true Convert? a real Penitent, a new Creature, one born again? Have I an intereſt in Chriſt? And is my peace made with God through him? or am I as yet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170311:96"/> in the ſtate of Nature, under the guilt of all my ſins, with the wrath of God abiding on me? If ſo, is this a Condition to be reſted in?</p>
               <p>Let me adviſe thee, as thou loveſt thy ſoul, to deal faithfully, and in good ſadneſſe with thy ſelf: Let me adviſe thee to review, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to reflect upon the whole courſe of thy life paſt; And (beſides thy natural vileneſſe) Conſider, how many actual ſins, failings, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and violations of Gods righteous Law, omiſſions of good, commiſſions of evil, thou haſt been guilty of, in the ſeveral parts of thy life, and in the ſeveral places where thou haſt lived. Believe it, few people do reckon up one ſin of ten that they are guilty of. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy Conſcience therefore, a liberty to ſpeak freely to thee, and to ſet thy ſins in order before thee. And if thou findeſt thy ſelf for the preſent in a bad condition, and that the caſe is not with thee as it ſhould be, conſider whether it will not be an extream folly and madneſſe, to go on in that courſe, not minding, nor regarding ſpeedily to turn to God, and to ſettle the great affairs of thy ſoul, while thou haſt time? O Remember, remember, thou haſt a precious and immortal ſoul, that muſt be ſhortly either in Heaven, or Hell; either in unconceiveable Joyes, or in endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, and remedileſſe torments. Doth it not therefore concern thee to conſider, and caſt about, how to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170311:97"/> attain the one, and eſcape the other? Doth it not behoove thee to look to the ſecuring of the main Chance, and to deliver thy ſelf from the wrath to come? Believe it, nothing undoes mankind more, than want of due and ſerious Conſideration; than want of frequent exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtate of their Conſciences, and often pondering and thinking of their everlaſting Concernments.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. The evil of ſin appears in theſe ſeven particulars;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis contrary to Gods holy Nature.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>It makes the ſoul like unto the devil.</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is Gods Nature: Sin and wickedneſſe is the devils. 'Twas ſin that at firſt, turn'd An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

               <p n="2">II. The great danger of ſin appears in that it brings ſuch a guilt upon the ſoul, as makes it liable to Gods wrath and curſe, and to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Temporal: Sickneſs, pain, vexation, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, death:</hi> which to the wicked are truly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and fruits of Gods vindicative ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and have their ſting ſtill in them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Contrition, <hi>Godly ſorrow, broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart for ſin.</hi> To be ſorry for what we have done amiſſe, is ſomething towards repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but it is not the <hi>whole</hi> of it. <hi>Gracious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi> is a deep and hearty grieving for all our ſins, and that upon theſe <hi>Goſpel Motives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we have by our ſins highly <hi>diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> and <hi>offended</hi> our gracious God, whom we had all the reaſon in the world to have ſtudied to pleaſe. The <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> and offence of God is that which ſets the ſoul a bleeding and mourning <hi>evangelically.</hi> Conſider therefore, what is the <hi>Spring</hi> of thy ſorrow. If the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>ſhame</hi> of thy ſins touch thee nearer than the <hi>offence</hi> of God, 'tis a ſign thy ſorrow is not right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe our ſins pierced our dear Lord and Saviour, and put him to ſuch grievous, painful, and ſhameful ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe by our ſins we have brought a horrible defilement, and ſtain on our ſouls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe we have made our ſelves liable to the wrath and curſe of God, and deſerve to be ſeparated from the Lord, and to be puniſhed among devils, and damned fiends for ever. This (in conjunction with the former) is an <hi>Evangelical motive.</hi> I confeſſe, to <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>howl,</hi> and <hi>grieve,</hi> meerly for the wrath and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment <hi>ſin</hi> has brought upon the ſoul, is ſuch a ſorrow, as <hi>Judas</hi> had his ſhare in; and the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170311:100"/> damned in Hell exceed in it. But <hi>this ſorrow</hi> does not uſe to leave the ſoul in a <hi>better diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for obedience in time to come, as godly ſorrow doth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance unto life,</hi> And <hi>take notice by the way,</hi> this Godly ſorrow, is not a <hi>flower</hi> that growes in the <hi>Garden</hi> of nature. <hi>A hard heart is Adams Legacy:</hi> There may be a <hi>flexible nature,</hi> where there is a <hi>hard heart,</hi> that knowes not how to mourn and grieve for ſin in a right manner. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow is voluntary.</hi> The ſoul is <hi>active</hi> in it, <hi>prayes</hi> for ſuch a melting frame, is <hi>thankful</hi> for it, is beſt <hi>pleaſed</hi> when the heart is <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and deeply affected for its ſins and offences againſt God. 'Tis not ſo in <hi>worldly ſorrow;</hi> for in <hi>that</hi> we are meerly <hi>paſſive;</hi> It comes upon us without ſending for, or being bidden wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hating, and Loathing ſin. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſanctification works a ſecret <hi>antipathy,</hi> an irreconcileable <hi>hatred</hi> in the ſoul againſt ſin. The true penitent hates ſin, <hi>as ſin:</hi> As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. <hi>I hate every falſe way, True ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is to the whole kind.</hi> When we hate ſin, <hi>as ſin,</hi> we hate <hi>all ſin.</hi> Now the reaſon why there is ſuch an <hi>univerſal</hi> hatred, in the true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent againſt all ſin, is</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>his judgment is altered,</hi> his mind is changed; he ſees with other eies than he did before; He ſees the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of ſin in
<pb facs="tcp:170311:101"/> thoſe particulars before mentioned. He ſees plainly that <hi>ſin is but like a cup of ſweet wine, that hath rank poiſon in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His heart and affections are turned against it.</hi> He hath <hi>a new heart</hi> put into him. If God ſhould offer him his <hi>choice</hi> of theſe two things, either a <hi>liberty</hi> to go on in ſin, or <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> againſt it, he would readily cloſe with the latter. The <hi>remembrance</hi> of ſin is bitter, and grievous to him; not ſo, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction; he bleſſes God for afflictions, that have weaned his heart from ſin. He is <hi>ſick</hi> of ſin, <hi>weary</hi> of it, 'tis a burden to him, his heart riſes againſt it; he had rather God ſhould exerciſe him with any affliction, than give him up to a hardned courſe in ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Confeſſion of ſin. Every <hi>true penitent</hi> is bound to make private confeſſion of his ſins to God, praying earneſtly for the pardon of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this meanes the ſoul is brought into a <hi>diſlike</hi> of ſin. Confeſſion 'tis an <hi>act of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> 'Tis the <hi>ſpiritual vomit</hi> of the ſoul; it breeds a diſlike of the ſweet morſels of ſin, when they are thus caſt up again with loathing. <hi>Sin though ſweet in commiſſion, is bitter in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and confeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>a free ingenuous</hi> confeſſion of ſin, we <hi>accuſe</hi> our ſelves unto God; <hi>take ſhame</hi> to our ſ lves, <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> our ſelves before him, humbly <hi>acknowledging</hi> we are worthy of all his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170311:101"/> curſes, all his judgments. Now <hi>ſelf accuſing</hi> will prevent <hi>Satans accuſing</hi> of us. He can lay no more to our charge, than we in our confeſſions are willing to charge our ſelves with: And <hi>ſelf-judging</hi> will prevent <hi>Gods judging</hi> of us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi> We are not to <hi>judge others,</hi> but we may and muſt <hi>judge our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of ſin take theſe Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Confeſſe all thy particular known ſins parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly:</hi> Take thy ſelf <hi>in private,</hi> and open the caſe of thy ſoul <hi>clearly,</hi> and <hi>without guile of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> before the Lord, make private confeſſion of all thy ſins unto him: not that thou canſt <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint God</hi> with any thing he did not before. know; but that it may appear, <hi>thou thy ſelf knoweſt,</hi> and art acquainted with the <hi>plague of thine own heart,</hi> and art ſenſible of thy ſins, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and defects in obedience. And ſeeing every one is guilty of many more ſins than he can remember, though he examine his heart and life <hi>never ſo ſeriouſly:</hi> Therefore when thou haſt humbly <hi>confeſſed,</hi> and bewailed all thy <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular known ſins</hi> to God, then with <hi>a general confeſſion</hi> acknowledge the reſt; namely, all thy <hi>ſecret, unknown, undiſcovered</hi> ſins; ſaying, as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19.12. <hi>Lord cleanſe me from my ſecret ſins.</hi> Cleanſe me O Lord, not only from thoſe <hi>particular ſins</hi> I do remember, and humbly confeſſe before thee, but from <hi>all other ſins</hi> alſo
<pb facs="tcp:170311:102"/> that I am <hi>any manner of way</hi> guilty of, though I do not now remember them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Remember,</hi> that 'tis not only <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>handſome expreſſions</hi> God regards in confeſſion of ſin, but there muſt be <hi>ſhame,</hi> a <hi>deep ſenſe</hi> and feeling of the evil of ſin, a <hi>heart hatred</hi> againſt ſin, a true <hi>ſorrow</hi> for all our offences againſt God, that muſt accompany our confeſſions, elſe they are no way pleaſing unto him.</p>

A true and real penitent does not content himſelf with a meer <hi>negative holineſſe,</hi> and leaving off his former ſinful waies. 'Tis not <hi>enough</hi> for ſuch an one to be no <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi> no <hi>ſwearer,</hi> no <hi>unclean</hi> perſon, <hi>&amp;c. But as he hates every evil way, ſo he makes Conſcience of every known duty required of him.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that require duty, are as binding to him, as thoſe that forbid ſin. There will be a viſible change in ſuch a perſon; and that</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reference to God: He will love God more, and delight in his waies and worſhip now,</hi> more than formerly.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>If he remember he has wronged any man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in his goods, or eſtate, either by defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or unjuſt detaining what is due to him, he will endeavour to make him reſtitution, or other ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If he be at variance with any, he will deſire

               <p>Thus much of the <hi>nature</hi> of true Repentance. I come now to ſome <hi>Directions</hi> concerning, it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Remember,</hi> Repentance (though never ſo ſerious) is not to be <hi>reſted in,</hi> as any <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> for ſin, or any cauſe of the pardon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (that being the act of Gods free Grace in Chriſt) yet it is of ſuch <hi>neceſſity</hi> to ſinners, that none may expect pardon without it.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>neceſſary</hi> for theſe three Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe God hath commanded it, and the Goſpel enjoynes it, as a condition of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That we may taſt ſomething of the bitterneſſe of ſin, that ſo we may the more carefully avoid it for the time to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To prepare and fit us to receive pardon, to diſpoſe us into ſuch a frame, as is ſutable to ſuch a bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To make us ſet a higher value on Gods pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mercy, and Chriſts Merits, and Blood. How dear and precious is Chriſt to a ſoul truly humbled for ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170311:104"/>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Conſider,</hi> As there is no ſin <hi>ſo ſmall,</hi> but it deſerves <hi>damnation,</hi> ſo there is no ſin <hi>ſo great,</hi> that it can bring damnation upon thoſe <hi>who truly repent. 'Tis not the falling into the water, drowns a man, but continuing in it, not getting out again.</hi> No ſin damnes a man, but as it is accompanied with <hi>finall impenitency</hi> and <hi>unbelief: Therefore the ſin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that commit that ſin do never repent, or flie to Chriſt for pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Look to it, that thy Repentance, and ſorrow for thy ſins, ſpring from <hi>Evangelicall Motives, (ſuch as are before mentioned,)</hi> and not meerly from ſhame or fear of Hell &amp; wrath.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Labour that thy ſorrow for ſin, may bear ſome <hi>proportion</hi> to the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of thy ſins; Every ſmall <hi>touch</hi> of ſorrow may not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: <hi>As ſin is the greateſt of evils, ſo our ſorrow for it ſhould be the greateſt ſorrow.</hi> Betake thy ſelf therefore <hi>to a more ſolemn mourning,</hi> and renting of heart <hi>for the great ſins</hi> of thy life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be comforted, with any worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, till thou haſt obtained thy pardon: But <hi>remember</hi> Godly ſorrow is not alwaies to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by <hi>plenty of tears,</hi> and vehemency of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but by the <hi>weight</hi> of it on the heart, by the <hi>deep diſpleaſure</hi> of the ſoul againſt ſin: <hi>There may be a deep, rational ſorrow for ſin, where there is no ſuch outward paſſionate expreſſions of it.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. When a poor ſinner doth caſt himſelf wholly on Chriſt crucified for pardon and life, <hi>(upon the warrant of the promiſe)</hi> although he hath no aſſurance in himſelf, how the Lord will diſpoſe of him. This is commonly called <hi>Faith of Adherence,</hi> or <hi>Recumbency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. When a ſoul that hath thus caſt himſelf on Chriſt, reflects upon what he hath done, and comparing it with the <hi>Goſpel promiſes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>(by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, bearing witneſſe with his Spirit)</hi> confidently perſwaded of his <hi>intereſt</hi> in Chriſt, and that he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him. This is call'd <hi>Faith of Aſſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>former</hi> is <hi>that Faith</hi> which is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the new Covenant,</hi> by which a ſinner is freely acquitted of all his ſins, and accounted as a righteous and juſt perſon in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Faith,</hi> there are theſe <hi>ſix things</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A real, firm belief of the <hi>truth of the Goſpel,</hi> a true <hi>hiſtorical Faith,</hi> concerning Chriſts <hi>perſon, undertaking,</hi> and <hi>performance,</hi> and that he came to be a Mediatour and Peace-maker between God and man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A deep ſenſe and feeling of the heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin, with true ſorrow and humiliation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hereupon. The ſoul is brought to ſee its undone
<pb facs="tcp:170311:109"/> condition by ſin, before it cloſes with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A firm perſwaſion that there is no other way of ſalvation, but by Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A clear knowledge that Chriſt is <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come to God by him;</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to ſave, and <hi>ready</hi> to receive <hi>ſuch</hi> as do own him for the <hi>true Meſſias,</hi> and <hi>unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly</hi> give up themſelves unto him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An earneſt deſire, a real thirſting after an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in this Saviour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. An actual <hi>giving up</hi> the ſoul to Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on him <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>alone</hi> for pardon and life; firmly truſting in him to be <hi>juſtified, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and everlaſtingly <hi>ſaved</hi> by him.</p>
               <p>This is the ſoul <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> united unto Chriſt.

               <p>So that when we do willingly betroth our ſelves to Chriſt, and conſent to take him for our Lord and Husband, and to be his loyall ſpouſe: when we are willing to be in ſubjection to him, and to be ruled by him, as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body are by the head: when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and reſt and rely on him alone for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as the ſtones reſt on the foundation: Laſtly, when we derive Grace and Holineſſe from him, as the branches derive juice, vertue, and ſap from the root and ſtock, and do bring forth fruits <hi>in him,</hi> and <hi>to him;</hi> then is there a <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual union</hi> wrought between Chriſt and our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of ſaving Faith: The <hi>Concluſions</hi> I ſhall lay down concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, are theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though Chriſt hath paid down a <hi>ſufficient</hi> price on the Croſſe, for the <hi>ranſoming</hi> and <hi>buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in</hi> of loſt and undone ſinners, yet we are not <hi>juſtified</hi> and abſolved from the guilt of our ſins, till we do <hi>actually cloſe</hi> with him by Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True <hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> is not a <hi>ſtrong perſwaſion,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:170311:110"/> that all a mans ſins are pardoned by Chriſt's Merits, and that <hi>he is in Gods Favour,</hi> and in a good ſtate and condition: For 'tis evident ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods dear ſervants are exerciſed with <hi>doubts,</hi> and <hi>feares</hi> concerning themſelves; and many <hi>Graceleſſe wretches,</hi> that never felt the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin, nor ever made much Conſcience of walking holily, are <hi>moſt confident</hi> of their own good condition: Therefore this <hi>confident, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded perſwaſion</hi> cannot be true Faith; for then, <hi>hardneſſe of heart,</hi> would make the beſt Faith; and he that could <hi>preſume moſt,</hi> and be moſt <hi>ſecure,</hi> and free from doubts, would be the <hi>trueſt believer.</hi> For a man to be <hi>confident</hi> of his good condition, while he lies under the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>reign</hi> of ſin, is the <hi>groſſeſt unbelief</hi> in the world: 'Tis to believe the flat <hi>contrary</hi> to what God hath revealed in the Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicatours, nor Idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Therefore a <hi>confident reſting</hi> on Chriſt for ſalvation, <hi>(if it be not a reſting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word)</hi> will not ſerve the turn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Fiducially,</hi> and <hi>ſavingly</hi> to believe on Chriſt, is not an <hi>act</hi> of mans power, but wrought in the ſoul by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God; who doth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170311:110"/> 
                  <hi>effectually enlighten, perſwade,</hi> and <hi>draw the heart,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſt,</hi> and <hi>enable</hi> the ſoul, <hi>to give up it ſelf</hi> unto Chriſt. Beg therefore the aſſiſtance of this bleſſed Spirit, <hi>whom God hath promiſed to give to them that ask him, Luke</hi> 11.9. And in the aid of his Grace, give up thy ſelf <hi>unfeignedly</hi> unto Chriſt, to be juſtified, ſanctified, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſaved by him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A true believer</hi> may <hi>fear,</hi> and be in doubt, that he hath not given up himſelf to Chriſt <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly;</hi> and this fear may proceed from the abundance of his <hi>love</hi> to Chriſt, and <hi>earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> to be aſſur'd of an <hi>intereſt</hi> in him, which makes him think he can never be certain enough of him; <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>ſollicitous,</hi> and full of fears, leſt it ſhould miſſe the perſon beloved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They that <hi>truly cloſe</hi> with Chriſt, do <hi>take</hi> him for their <hi>Lord,</hi> as well as for their <hi>Saviour.</hi> None come to Chriſt by Faith, and <hi>ſavingly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, but they cleave to him by <hi>love</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and live to him by <hi>obedience. True Faith on Chriſt, will beget love to Chriſt, and love will bring forth obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſureſt mark of true believing in Chriſt, is <hi>a new</hi> and <hi>holy life.</hi> 'Tis the property of Faith <hi>to purifie the heart,</hi> and ſo to work a change in the life and converſation. Doſt thou make Conſcience therefore of all Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? And art thou careful to <hi>refrain thy feet from every evil way? Who ever is in Christ, is a
<pb facs="tcp:170311:111"/> new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>Hath the love of Chriſt ſhed abroad in his heart, and that love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines him to yeeld ſincere obedience: Hath the Spirit of Chriſt, Rom</hi> 8.9. not only to <hi>comfort</hi> him, but to <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> him, to lead him in the paths of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and to <hi>uphold</hi> him from taking any deſperate and <hi>irrecoverable falls,</hi> either in matter of <hi>judgment</hi> or <hi>practiſe.</hi> Theſe are the Concluſions.</p>
               <p>I come now in the third place, to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Encouragements to believe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider for thy encouragement, how <hi>able</hi> Chriſt is to ſave thee. There is more <hi>merit</hi> in the Son of God, to obtain our pardon, than there is <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin in us, to merit condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the <hi>perſon ſuffering,</hi> being (as to his God-head) <hi>infinite,</hi> and the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>value</hi> of his ſufferings depending on the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of his <hi>perſon,</hi> the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made, muſt needs be <hi>infinite,</hi> and ſo <hi>abundantly ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider his <hi>willingneſs</hi> and readineſſe to accept to mercy <hi>all poor humbled ſinners,</hi> that come unto him: He never rejected any man that came unto him, and acknowledged him for the <hi>true Meſſias,</hi> and <hi>unfeignedly</hi> gave up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſaved by him.</p>
               <p>His <hi>willingneſſe</hi> to ſave ſinners, cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to thee, if thou conſidereſt theſe <hi>three</hi> things. 1. His gracious words before he came into the world. The Prophet in the perſon of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170311:111"/> Chriſt, proclaims thus, Iſa. 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters,</hi> &amp;c. 2. His <hi>free</hi> and <hi>general</hi> invitation when he was in the world, John 7.37. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, if any one thirſt, let him come to me and drink,</hi> And Mat. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> 3. His great kindneſſe to poor ſinners expreſſed after his <hi>aſcention,</hi> and leaving the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Let him that is athirst come, and whoſoever will, let him take the waters of life freely:</hi> That theſe were the words of Chriſt, appeares, <hi>v.</hi> 20. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>He that teſtifieth theſe things, ſaith, ſurely I come quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that to <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>reſt on</hi> Chriſt crucified, and to take him for our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> is to perform that <hi>act,</hi> to which <hi>juſtification</hi> and remiſſion of ſins is promiſed, John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Chriſt and all his benefits are promiſed to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul. Wilt thou not therefore give up thy ſelf to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, 'tis the <hi>duty</hi> of all truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinners, to go to Chriſt, and believe in him. 'Tis the <hi>duty</hi> of a ſick man, to apply himſelf to a skilful Phyſitian; and as <hi>ſuch an one</hi> muſt not deſtroy his own life, by a wilful refuſing the
<pb facs="tcp:170311:112"/> Phyſick that would cure him; ſo neither muſt <hi>the humbled ſinner</hi> deſtroy his own ſoul, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to cloſe with Chriſt; He muſt not add to all the reſt of his ſins <hi>unbelief,</hi> and a <hi>wilfull neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Christ,</hi> and the ſalvation by him purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo freely offered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider that the humbled ſinner by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, does not only bring <hi>comfort,</hi> and ſalvation to his own ſoul, but alſo in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner brings <hi>Glory</hi> to God: When thou (though diſcouraged in thy ſelf, by reaſon of thy ſins) dareſt venture thy ſoul in the hands of Chriſt: When thou makeſt thy way through all <hi>doubts, ſcruples,</hi> and <hi>miſgivings of heart,</hi> and takeſt Gods bare Word, becauſe he hath ſaid it, (thereby ſetting thy ſeal to his truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe) and doſt reſolve to throw thy ſelf on his free Mercy, and Chriſt's Merits, for pardon and life, to lay thy ſoul at Chriſt's feet, and to claſp about him, though he kill thee: This is an excellent, and an <hi>heroical act</hi> of Faith, which brings Glory to God; as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith did: Of whom it is ſaid, Rom. 4.20. <hi>That he ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not at the promiſe of God through unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider, 'tis the greateſt folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the world, for an humbled ſinner not to cloſe with Chriſt, and commit his ſoul unto him. What an <hi>irrational,</hi> and <hi>unprofitable</hi> ſin is unbelief? If we go not to Chriſt, Where
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170311:112"/> can ſalvation poſſibly be had? As thoſe lepers reaſoned, 2 King. 7.3. <hi>If we ſit ſtill we periſh. That perſon is ſure to be damned, that keeps off from Chriſt.</hi> There is no way therefore for a poor ſinner, but to venture himſelf into the hands of Chriſt, to give up his ſoul <hi>ſincerely</hi> to him, and to reſolve with himſelf, <hi>if I periſh, I will periſh at his feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, If you think you have cauſe to fear that Chriſt is not yet <hi>yours,</hi> and as yet you have no intereſt in him, my advice is, that you <hi>now</hi> go unto him, now ſtrike up the <hi>Covenant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and you: Defer no longer; Let this be the <hi>marriage-day.</hi> Now give up thy ſelf unfeignedly to be pardoned, ſanctified commanded, diſpoſed of, and everlaſtingly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him; and reſt aſſured he will on no terms caſt thee out.</p>

The morning is an embleme of the Reſurrection, when our bodies ſhall awake from the ſleep of death, and that long day ſhall ariſe upon us, that ſhall never have any night. O how ſhouldſt thou then, when ſleep fals from thine eyes, lift up thy ſoul in praiſes and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings to the Lord, for his gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over thee in the night ſeaſon. Had not he been exceeding gracious, thou mightſt have ſlept the ſleep of death, and from the darkneſſe of the night been ſent away into outer darkneſſe. Let not the <hi>commonneſſe</hi> of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>diminiſh,</hi> but the <hi>continualneſs</hi> of it rather <hi>encreaſe</hi> thy thankfulneſſe.

I laid me down and ſlept, and thou haſt ſuſtained me. I have been ſafe under the ſhadow of thy wings, thy faithfulneſſe, and truth have been my ſhield and buckler, And now Lord, lift up the Light of thy Countenance upon me, inſtruct me in the way wherein I ſhould go, and guid me with thine eye. Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy Truth, O knit my
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170311:118"/> heart to thee, that I may fear thy Name. And hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footſteps ſlip not. Let me walk circumſpectly this day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the time, Let my ſoul put on the Lord Jeſus, and be clothed with the white robe of his righteouſneſſe, and adorn me with the ſaving Graces of thy holy Spirit, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Omit not daily to poure forth thy Soul in ſecret and fervent prayer before the Lord, humbly confeſſing, and bewailing thy ſins, with a deep ſenſe and feeling of the evil, danger, and deſert of them; begging earneſtly (as for thy life) a ful and free pardon and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of them all in the blood of Chriſt, and humbly imploring the aid and aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit, to enable thee to mortifie thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, to reſiſt temptations, and to perform in a right manner all the duties required of thee.</p>
               <p>Be much in this duty of ſecret prayer, if ever thou intendeſt to ſave thy ſoul, to honour God here, or to be happy with him hereafter. And remember that to pray unto God in an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, is not to ſay over a few prayers, or to utter a few petitions (Patrat-like) in a formal, cold, cuſtomary manner; where there is not a true ſenſe and feeling of ſin and miſery; and where the deſires of the ſoul are not carried out earneſtly to ſeek for mercy, and relief from God through Chriſt, there can be no true hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty praying, ſuch as God will accept, though the outſide and external part of the duty be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170311:120"/> never ſo ſpeciouſly. God more regards the ſighes, and tears, and broken expreſſions of a truly contrite and humble heart, that are powred forth in ſecret before him, than the moſt ſet, and exactly form'd devotions, that proceed either from formality or hypocriſie. If thou wouldeſt therefore pray aright, beg the aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit of God, to help and enable thee; for <hi>we know not how to pray as we ought, except the Spirit help our infirmities.</hi> Beg therefore the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, to work, and quicken in thy heart thoſe apprehenſions, affections, and Graces, which are requiſite for the right performance of this duty, And with that gracious aſſiſtance labour to pray,</p>
               <p n="1">1. With humility, and reverence, having an high and awful apprehenſion of the Majeſty of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With a deep ſenſe, and feeling of thy wants and neceſſities: and with brokenneſſe of heart, and true contrition for thy ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Offer up thy prayers and ſupplications to God in the Name of Chriſt, the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour between God and man, not barely menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning his Name, but drawing thy encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pray, and thy hope of acceptance in prayer, from his Merits, Mediation, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pray in Faith, humbly truſting in Gods Power, Goodneſſe, Faithfulneſſe, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170311:121"/> promiſes made in Chriſt; not ſo much a Chriſtians prayer, as his Faith in prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth with God. And 'tis a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Faith, to conſider, there is not only bounty in God, but bounty engaged by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. O how great are the priviledges of Saints? God is their Father willing to hear their prayers; Chriſt is their Advocate willing to preſent their requeſts; the holy Ghoſt is their helper and aſſiſter to draw up their requeſts for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Lift up pure hands without wrath,</hi> as the Apoſtle adviſeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. Before thou ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy ſelf to this duty, labour to get thy heart purged of all malice, wrath, ill will, and deſire of revenge, if there be any ſuch vile affection in thee towards any body. When thou goeſt to pray, thou goeſt to beg forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy manifold ſins from God; which thou canſt not reaſonably expect, if thou art not willing to forgive others: Our Saviour hath taught us to pray, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſses, as we forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi> And this is very remarkeable, he reſumes this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the reſt to explain and by a ſtrong reaſon to enforce; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>For if you forgive men their treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will alſo forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſses.</hi> Remember therefore, that it is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170311:121"/> thy duty, heartily to forgive thoſe that have done thee any wrong; and to pray for them, that God would pardon them in his Son, and give them ſuch a frame of heart, that they may pleaſe him, and be bleſſed by him, both here and hereafter. This is a good ſigne of Grace, to pray for a bleſſing on our very enemies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Pray in ſincerity; Looke that thy end be right, and that thy aim be at the Glory of God. There is a great deal of difference betwixt a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſire, and a gracious ſupplication, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Ye ask and have not, becauſe ye ask amiſſe, to ſpend it on your luſts.</hi> Praiers that want a good aim, do uſually want a good iſſue. When thou findeſt thy heart running out by a perverſe aim, check it, and diſclaim it the more ſolemnly. If our praiers be not directed to the Glory of God, there is little hope that when we receive the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent we pray for, we ſhall employ it to our Maſters uſe. They that cannot ask a mercy well, ſeldome uſe it well.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Labour to pray with zeal, fervency, warmth, and holy importunity, with ſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſtrong workings of affection. 'Tis eaſie to ſay a prayer in a formal, cold manner, when the heart is nothing affected with it, but poſſibly wandring, while the lips are praying: But that is true prayer, when the ſoul reaches out after thoſe things it praies for, in holy, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſpiritual deſires. Sighs and groans
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170311:122"/> are the Language God underſtands. When God meaneth to beſtow any bleſſing, he uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirs up the hearts of his people earneſtly to pray for it. And the effuſion of the Spirit of ſupplication, that holy, yet humble importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that ſpiritual violence, and wreſtling and ſtriving, and pleading with the Almighty, is a happy preſage of an approaching bleſſing.</p>

Beg ſpiritual bleſſings, and the things appertaining to the ſoul <hi>primarily,</hi> and with greateſt earneſtneſſe: Beg temporall mercies, and ſuch as concern this life, and thy welfare here, <hi>with an humble ſubmiſſion unto God;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning thy will to his moſt holy will; earneſtly begging, that, what he ſees not good for thee, nor fit to be granted thee, he would make thee willing and contented to be without.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To ſupplication, forget not to adde praiſes and thankſgivings to the Lord for all his benefits; for his innumerable favours confer'd on thee in the courſe of thy life paſt, and alſo for thy preſent enjoyments. Eſpecially quicken and provoke and awaken thy ſoul to lift up the high praiſes of God, for his ineſtimable love in ſending his Son, to be a ranſome for ſin, and ſending his Holy Spirit to convince of ſin, and of righteouſneſſe, and to perſwade, and enable thy heart to cloſe with Chriſt. And laſtly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt of any new mercy and favour from God, offer up a cheerful and hearty ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170311:122"/> of praiſe and thankſgiving, <hi>in and through the mediation of Christ,</hi> by whom alone our Perſons, and Sacrifices are accepted with God.</p>
               <p>And to direct and quicken thee to this duty, of rendring praiſes to the Lord; Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That praiſe is Gods Tribute, his Cuſtom, 'tis all the Impoſt he ſets upon his Bleſſings. There are three things to be conſidered in a mercy. 1. The mercy it ſelf. 2. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ſweetneſſe that may be enjoyed in the uſe of it. 3. The Glory, Honour, and Praiſe that is due for it. The two former God freely gives us; he only reſerves the latter as a tribute and homage to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Praiſing God for former mercies, invites him to beſtow new mercies. God will be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to thoſe that he ſees thankfull; and from whom he receives Glory and acknowledgment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Praiſing God is the beginning of Heaven, 'tis the employment of the holy Angels, and glorified Saints there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To have a heart delighting in praiſing God, is a great evidence (in conjunction with others) of ſincerity; ſelf-love forceth prayer oftentimes from us; but to praiſe God aright, cometh from a more heavenly affect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on, and a ſanctified frame of heart.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To ſet upon this duty of praiſing God is one of the beſt waies to mitigate any ſorrowes that at any time are upon us. If we can work
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170311:123"/> our hearts to praiſe him for the mercies that are continued to us, it will exceedingly abate the ſenſe and feeling of any preſent Croſſe, or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that lies upon us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider who <hi>they</hi> are that are the moſt unthankfull to God; even <hi>Devils, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits,</hi> who are full of envy, malice, and pride; they will not praiſe God, but do wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly blaſpheme him; and <hi>wicked men,</hi> who imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their Father the devil. And wouldeſt thou be like theſe?</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations ſtir up thy heart to be much in this heavenly duty of praiſing God, and remember 1. To praiſe him with thy heart. 2. To praiſe him with thy tongue. 3. To praiſe him with thy life.</p>
               <p>Let there be an abiding ſenſe of his favours on thy heart, and let thy life and converſation praiſe him alſo. <hi>Let thy works praiſe him,</hi> that <hi>others ſeeing thy good works, may glorifie thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father.</hi> Labour to ſecure thy ſtate in Grace, and thy intereſt in Gods favour, through Chriſt, and then thou maiſt be aſſured, that whatever God gives thee, he gives it thee in pure love; all comes ſwimming to thee in the blood of Chriſt; and this Conſideration will exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly raiſe thy heart to thankfulneſſe, and make thy tongue ſound forth the praiſes of the moſt High.</p>
               <p>Theſe Directions may help thee in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170311:123"/> of that great Chriſtian duty of praier, and thankſgiving,</p>
               <p>After thou haſt praied, Conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. What thou haſt praied for. As before praier we ſhould conſider and labour to find out our wants; So after prayer we ſhould conſider of our petitions, and what we have begged of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Humbly expect a gracious anſwer, and return to thy praiers, not for any worthineſſe or deſert in thy ſelf, or praiers, but for Chriſt's ſake alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Serve Providence in the uſe of fair and lawful means, for the attaining thoſe good things thou haſt prayed for.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To Prayer add watchfulneſſe. If through Grace thy heart hath been wrought to a good temper, and holy frame in prayer; labour to keep it afterward; labour to preſerve thoſe apprehenſions and thoſe affections in thy ſoul, which thou foundeſt in time of prayer; And therefore one well adviſeth, that for ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after we have prayed, we ſhould keep our ſelves ſilent, and quiet; nor preſently (and in the next moment as ſome do,) but fair and ſoftly removing our hearts from our prayers to our worldly buſineſſes and occaſions.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be frequent, and diligent in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>When thou readeſt the Commands, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Threatnings therein contained, think God ſpeaks to thee in them; And God muſt needs be true, he cannot lie, nor de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                  <p>Now there is ſufficient evidence that the Scripture is his Word, and written by the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial inſpiration of his holy Spirit; and that will appear if we conſider theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The internal Light of its own perfection. The holineſſe and heavenlineſſe of the matter; the Majeſty of the Stile; the Conſent of all the Parts; the Scope of the whole (which is to give all Glory to God) and the full diſcovery therein made of the only way of mans ſalvation and reconciliation with God. Which is a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table way both to Gods Glory, and mans Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The many providential atteſtations and confirmations of the Truth of the things therein contained, by real and undeniable miracles, ſuch as could not be wrought but by the power of God. And ſurely, if the Scripture had been only the device of men, God would ſome way or other have diſowned it ere this, as a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170311:129"/> abuſe put upon him, and not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly have preſerved it in ſpight of the Devil, and all his inſtruments, who have laboured to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it out of the world, and to weaken the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The great and wonderful efficacy of the doctrine therein delivered, to enlighten, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and humble ſinners; to drive them out of themſelves, and to draw them to Chriſt, to conform them to the Image of God, to ſubdue them to his will, to ſtrengthen them againſt temptations and corruptions, to build them up in Grace, to eſtabliſh their hearts in holineſſe; and laſtly, to comfort them through Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>As therefore the holy Ghoſt by ſpecial inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, was the author of the Scripture, and by extraordinary endowments was the author of the miracles wrought for its confirmation; ſo alſo he is the author of the Faith of him that truly and unfeignedly believes it. Yet he doth not cauſe us to believe by <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> without any reaſon or evidence, but he enlightens the underſtanding (removing the blindneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravedneſſe thereof,) and ſhews us the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the thing, and the evidence of the truth that is to be believed, and ſo perſwades the heart to a belief thereof. Indeed, an hiſtorical belief of the Scripture (which is true in its kind) we may come to, by rational perſwaſions, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170311:130"/> the ſpecial Grace,</hi> or illumination of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; but not <hi>that deep and firm belief,</hi> which ſhall carry over the will effectually to God in Chriſt; and captivate the whole man to the obedience of the Truth. And when ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> of the Scripture as this, (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſanctification) is wrought in the ſoul; <hi>the effect is,</hi> a good argument, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth, and excellency of <hi>ſuch a Faith,</hi> and <hi>belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Labour therefore to work thy heart to a high and reverent eſteem of the Word, when thou goeſt to read it. We ſhould read it as a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by the hand of God from Heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. If an Angel ſhould bring us a letter from Heaven, we ſhould highly value it and regard it. The Bible is a meſſage ſent from Heaven, to acquaint us with the mind of God. If we own the divine authority thereof, let us read it with reverence, and due regard.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beg the Spirit of God (that endited the Scripture, that inſpired, and infallibly guided and aſſiſted the pen-men thereof) to open thy eies, to illuminate thy mind, and to encline thy heart to a full belief and perſwaſion that it is the very Word of God, and to bring over thy will to a ſincere obedience, and compliance with the will of God therein revealed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Remember that all things neceſſary to mans ſalvation, are either expreſly ſet down in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170311:130"/> the Scripture, or by good and neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may be deduced there-from: Unto which nothing is at any time to be added, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by new revelations, or traditions of men; it being a perfect Canon, a perfect rule of Faith and life. St. <hi>John,</hi> who outlived the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſealed up the Canon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. which was a great mercy to the world; For God ſaw what a liberty man enclin'd to in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, and therefore needed to be tyed up to a rule, which here is given us. There is enough delivered in the Scripture to make <hi>us wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. What ſhould a Chriſtian deſire more? and the Apoſtle tels us, we ought to give heed thereto till the day-ſtar ariſe in our hearts, that is, till we have full communion with Chriſt.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> on <hi>Jude.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Take notice, that thoſe things that are neceſſary to be known, believed, and obſerved for ſalvation, are ſo clearly propounded, and opened in ſome place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned alſo, in a due uſe of the ordinary means God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, may attain unto a ſufficient underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170311:131"/> places that ſpeak more clearly. The certain rule of interpreting the Scripture, is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf. <hi>The Scripture,</hi> ſaies <hi>Camero, is ſo penn'd, that they that have a mind to know, may know. They that have a mind to wrangle, may take occaſion enough of offence, and juſtly periſh by the rebellion of their own reaſon, for God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>to ſatisfie men of a ſtubborn and perverſe wit.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> long before him, hath told us, that <hi>God hath ſo diſpoſed the Scripture that they that will not be ſatisfied might be harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>

This was that which kept <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo upright, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Ask thy ſelf therefore often this queſtion, <hi>Will this be pleaſing to God that I am now going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout?</hi> If <hi>credit or ſhame</hi> will reſtrain thee from ſin, how much more ſhould <hi>Gods eie?</hi> Nothing more feeds, maintains, and preſerves <hi>Piety,</hi> than a conſtant <hi>awe of God.

                  <p>The <hi>fear of God</hi> is a Grace of continual uſe; If that be not before our eies, we are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to grow <hi>careleſſe</hi> and <hi>ſecure.</hi> We cannot be alwaies <hi>praying unto God,</hi> nor <hi>praiſing of him,</hi>

Yet we ought to be <hi>alwaies in his fear,</hi> and to remember, that we are <hi>alwaies under his eie. Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long;</hi> 'tis <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.17. <hi>Right thoughts of God</hi> are the <hi>fewel</hi> that maintaines the life of Religion, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would be ſoon extinguiſhed.

                  <p>The clearer therefore thou ſtandeſt in thy own thoughts, concerning the <hi>uprightneſs of thy heart,</hi> in the tenure of thy Chriſtian courſe, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably</hi> the more joy and comfort thou wilt have. <hi>Let integrity and uprightneſs preſerve me,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> praier, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Keep thy inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; and thy integrity will keep thee:</hi> A good man, next to his care that he give not <hi>God any occaſion</hi> againſt him, will take care that he give not <hi>his Conſcience any occaſion</hi> againſt him. Be afraid therefore of giving thy Conſcience any <hi>juſt occaſion to reproach, and rebuke thee; Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> 'tis Gods <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> within, that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to <hi>be a terrour not to good works, but to the evil.

There was a faultring of aſſent in our firſt parents to the truth of Gods commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation concerning eating of the forbidden tree, elſe they had not fallen ſo ſadly: and ſtill <hi>'tis</hi> the ground of all <hi>miſcarriages,</hi> of <hi>hardneſs of heart, and apoſtacy,</hi> Heb. 3.12, 13, <hi>Take heed, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin.</hi>

Did we firmly believe the <hi>Glory</hi> of Heaven, and the happineſſe of the life to come, we would be earneſt and zealous for the obtaining of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Direction</hi> 2. Labour to be well acquainted with the <hi>promiſes of God,</hi> and learn to ſtay thy ſoul upon them: If an able potent friend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170311:141"/> 
                     <hi>help</hi> in troubles, how are we cheared with it? Ought not the promiſes of God then to be a ſtrong conſolation to us? The proper life of a Chriſtian is to take his <hi>comforts,</hi> and <hi>ſupports</hi> from the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God, and not only from <hi>his outward providences.</hi> God many times alters the <hi>diſpenſations of his Providence,</hi> but does not alter his <hi>promiſes.</hi> The promiſes are the Saints inheritance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. <hi>No weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper; and every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt thee in judgment, thou ſhalt condemn; this is the heritage of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord,</hi> Whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> is at Gods right hand, and the <hi>Bible</hi> in the hand of gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they need not be dejected in any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul! and why art thou diſquieted within me!</hi> So <hi>David</hi> chides his ſoul, and rebukes his feares, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. and <hi>Pſal</hi> 77.10. <hi>This is my infirmitie,</hi> He bewailes his <hi>unbelief,</hi> and chides his heart for dejection and diſtruſt of Gods Providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Direction</hi> 3. Live upon God, and account him <hi>all in all,</hi> even in thy higheſt and fulleſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the creature. Let not the creature be the object of thy <hi>truſt</hi> at any time. <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> is the greateſt <hi>homage</hi> and reſpect we can yeeld to the Creatour. Therefore <hi>Job</hi> Chap. 31.24. ſaies, <hi>If I have made Gold my hope, or have ſaid to the fine Gold, thou art my confidence.</hi> V. 25. <hi>If I have rejoyced becauſe my
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170311:142"/> wealth was great, and becauſe my hand had gotten much,</hi> &amp;c. V. 28. <hi>I ſhould have denied the God that is above.</hi> Men are very apt to make riches the <hi>ſtaffe</hi> of their lives, and the <hi>ſtay</hi> of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; and ſo their hearts leaning on them, are taken off from God. The great danger of riches is the <hi>truſting</hi> in them, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.23. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith unto his Diſciples, how hardly ſhall thoſe that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> V. 24. <hi>And the Diſciples were aſtoniſhed at his word, But Jeſus anſwereth again, and ſaith unto them, children, how hard is it for them that truſt in riches to enter into the Kingdome of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many rich men are there, that look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as it were <hi>intrenched within their eſtates,</hi> and ſo promiſe themſelves ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all dangers. Thus God is not regarded, but their wealth, and worldly greatneſſe is made their <hi>rock</hi> and <hi>fortreſs:</hi> therefore <hi>covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is called Idolatry, Col</hi> 3.5. <hi>And the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man an Idolater,</hi> not ſo much for his <hi>love</hi> to riches, as his <hi>truſt</hi> in riches. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of making an <hi>Idol</hi> of the creature, do not build thy happineſſe, or felicity, on any thing thou doſt here enjoy. When God affords thee creature comforts, <hi>truſt</hi> not in them. Live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in the uſe, and live upon God in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Direction</hi> 4. Uſe lawful and fair means, for accompliſhing and bringing about thy lawful
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170311:142"/> deſignes, but let thy <hi>main trust</hi> be on God. Do thy duty, and commit thy ſelf and thy affairs to him in quietneſſe of heart. For a man to ſay, he truſts in God, and yet <hi>neglects to do his duty,</hi> this is but to mock God; a moderate care in the management of our aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irs is very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which puts a man upon <hi>praier,</hi> and an <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence</hi> in the uſe of lawful means; that once done, a Chriſtian ſhould labour after a holy <hi>moderation and compoſedneſſe of Spirit:</hi> and ſhould take heed his heart be not fixed too much on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing here below to his diſturbance. He ſhould put all his waies and affairs into Gods hands. He ſhould wait patiently, how God will caſt his affairs; and then ſubmit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſſe in the <hi>iſſues of Providence.</hi> O how ſweet a life leads that Chriſtian, who lives in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dependance on God! This kind of <hi>life</hi> diſcharges the creature of all that is burdenſom; of all carking cares, and tormenting fears; It leaves nothing upon him, but a conſcionable uſe of the means, no <hi>life</hi> makes us ſo <hi>humble,</hi> ſo <hi>lowly,</hi> ſo <hi>nothing</hi> in our own eies, as this <hi>life of Faith,</hi> which fetcheth all from God. Faith uſeth means, but truſteth in God alone.</p>
                  <p>In all thy affairs therefore ſtill ſeek to the Lord, and apply thy ſelf unto him, and truſt in him. We are dark creatures, and eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoot our ſelves; we have not wiſdome enough to manage our own affairs. God can counſell us,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170311:143"/> when we know not how to give counſell to our ſelves: And God takes it well to be <hi>adviſed</hi> with by us. Hereby we acknowledge our <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to him, when we will nor ſtir a foot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>adviſing</hi> with him, when we deſire not to be <hi>ordered</hi> by our own wiſdome, but <hi>truſt in the Lord with all our hearts, and do not lean to our own underſtanding;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. Take heed therefore of inordinate carefulneſſe, and diſtruſting God. Conſider the evil of rhis ſin in theſe four particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No ſin more diſhonours God, and robs him of his Glory, than this ſin doth. It cannot indeed rob God of his <hi>eſſentiall,</hi> but it does of his <hi>declarative Glory.</hi> We glorifie God <hi>declaratively</hi> when we <hi>truſt</hi> in him, and thereby declare to the world, that we own and acknowledge thoſe his excellencies of <hi>wiſdome, power, mercy, faithfulneſſe,</hi> which his Word aſcribes unto him: And therefore 'tis ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.20. <hi>That he ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered not at the promiſe of God through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi> V. 21. <hi>As being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. Unbelief</hi> doth blemiſh all thoſe <hi>four attributes</hi> of God, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>his Wiſdom, his Power, his Goodneſſe, his Faithfulneſſe;</hi> 'tis an interpretative blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170311:143"/> and calling all theſe into queſtion, and ſo an <hi>high injury</hi> and <hi>diſhonour</hi> unto God: Whereas faith is ſaid <hi>to juſtifie God,</hi> Luk. 7.29. that is, to profeſſe and acknowledge him to be <hi>ſuch a God</hi> as <hi>his Word</hi> reveals him to be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nothing doth more debar, and ſhut out Gods operation, in order to our <hi>relief</hi> and <hi>help</hi> than this ſin. If by taking only <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> and <hi>due care,</hi> we would reſigne up our ſelves, and our concernments into the hands of God, he would charge himſelf with us. But if we will <hi>immoderatly</hi> cark and care, and be ſo <hi>peremptory</hi> in our deſignes, and will not ſubmit them unto him; then God is diſcharged, we muſt look to our ſelves. Therefore 'tis not only our <hi>duty,</hi> but our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> to reſigne up our ſelves to God, and to ſubmit our concernments to his will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Unbelief</hi> 'tis a ſin, againſt which God hath exceedingly declar'd <hi>his diſpleaſure:</hi> The Apoſtle tels us, <hi>the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied in the wilderneſſe for unbelief;</hi> Many were their ſins there, <hi>Murmurings, luſtings, Idolatry,</hi> but the main reaſon of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, <hi>they believed not.</hi> Look to their <hi>finall exciſion,</hi> and <hi>cutting off,</hi> why what was it for? <hi>for unbelief</hi> were <hi>they broken off, Rom.</hi> 11.20. That noble man in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.2. was troden to death for <hi>diſtruſting Gods power,</hi> and could only ſee the plenty, did not taſt of it.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170311:144"/> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> could not enter into the land of promiſe becauſe of their <hi>unbelief,</hi> Num. 20.12. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes and Aaron, becauſe ye believe me not, to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie me in the eies of the children of Iſrael, therefore ye ſhall not bring this congregation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land which I have given them. Zachary</hi> was ſtruck dumb for not <hi>believing</hi> what God had revealed. Chriſt did never chide his Diſciples for any thing ſo much as <hi>their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> Luke 24.25. <hi>O ye fooles, and ſlow of heart to believe.</hi> And, <hi>why doubt ye O ye of little Faith,</hi> Mat. 8.26.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis a Paganiſh ſin, as our Saviour intimates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. For Heathens to be full of <hi>carking and caring,</hi> is not ſo much to be wondred at, but for us that profeſſe to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God,</hi> that do acknowledge a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Providence,</hi> and believe the happineſſe of another world, to be under the <hi>tyranny of diſtracting cares, anxiety of mind,</hi> and <hi>thoughtfulneſſe,</hi> (as if God had no care of us) this is an exceeding unworthy carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Take heed therefore of <hi>diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting God,</hi> and <hi>overcharging thy ſelf with the cares of this life.</hi> Let not thy heart be too much fixed on any thing here below. Lay not theſe outward things too <hi>much to heart.</hi> And remember that then cares are inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, when they cauſe ſuch a <hi>tumultuouſneſs,</hi>

And therefore our Saviour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. bids us <hi>take no thought,</hi> and repeats it <hi>three ſeveral times,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye ſhall put on.</hi> V. 31. <hi>Therefore take no thought, ſaying, What ſhall we eat? or what ſhall we drink; or wherewithall ſhall we be cloathed?</hi> V. 34. <hi>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow ſhall take thought for the things of it ſelf, ſufficient unto the day is the evil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Direction</hi> 5. Take heed of limiting God. 1. Either to the <hi>time</hi> of fulfilling his promiſes. Or 2. To the <hi>way; Faith</hi> doth not <hi>limit the holy One of Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>any ſet time,</hi> or <hi>any ſet means.</hi> Do thy duty therefore, and reſigne thy ſelf to God; Commit thy ſelf, and all concernments to his <hi>Fatherly care:</hi> and be not <hi>over-ſolicitous</hi> or perplexed about <hi>events.</hi> What ſtrange di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful language do the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> uſe

                     <hi>Direction</hi> 6. Reflect upon the Lords paſt kindneſſe, and gracious dealings with thee. Conſider how much God hath done for <hi>thee,</hi> and for <hi>others,</hi> that have <hi>truſted</hi> in him: and that will tend very much to encourage thee ſtill to <hi>truſt</hi> in him. The more experience and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Gods power and preſence thou haſt had, the greater reaſon thou haſt, <hi>to caſt away all unbelief from thee.</hi> It exceedingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that notwithſtanding ſo many experiences of his <hi>power,</hi> yet ſtill they diſtruſted him, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.11. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, unto Moſes, how long will this people provoke me? And how long will it be ere they believe me? for all the ſignes I have ſhewed among them.</hi> By e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very experience we ſhould grow up into a <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courage,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of Faith, as <hi>David</hi> drew inferences of <hi>hope</hi> againſt the preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, from the <hi>lion and the bear,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.36. <hi>Thy ſervant ſlew both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumciſed Philiſtine ſhall be as one of them,

Many duties depend on the conſideration and taking notice of Gods Providential diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. How <hi>blame worthy</hi> then are they, that do not care to obſerve or regard the works of God? Certainly, it is <hi>our duty,</hi> to obſerve and acknowledge Gods ſoveraignty and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the world, and over all events here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>(not a ſparrow, not a hair fals to the ground without our Heavenly Father)</hi> And where we cannot underſtand the waies of God, let us with an humble reverence believe, and admire the wiſdome of them. The deep and unſearcheable
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170311:149"/> waies of God are not to be judged before the Tribunal of mans reaſon. Labour therefore to get a firm belief of this <hi>great truth,</hi> ſetled in thy ſoul, <hi>that God governs all humane affairs,</hi> and thou wilt find it of great efficacy againſt thoſe damps and dejections of mind, that in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we are too prone unto; and it will be a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular antidote againſt all murmurings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings. How did <hi>this conſideration</hi> quiet and compoſe the heart of old <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> on the ſame account ſaies, <hi>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it, Pſal.</hi> 39.9. So when a ſore and terrible affliction fell upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> (his two ſons <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> being conſumed by fire from Heaven) all that the Scripture reports of his carriage and demeanour is this, <hi>And Aaron held his peace, Lev.</hi> 10.3. As therefore thou art dilgently to obſerve and mind Gods Providential diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, ſo remember it is thy <hi>duty,</hi> and ought to be <hi>the poſture of thy Spirit,</hi> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he <hi>takes</hi> from thee, or whatever he <hi>does</hi> unto thee, perfectly and abſolutely to ſubmit to his will. Remember there is no reſiſting the Almighty, <hi>Shall a Graſhopper contend with an Eagle? Shall we that are wormes contend with our maker?</hi> If we conſider our ſinfulneſſe and guilt, we have reaſon to admire he afflicts us no more; If as the <hi>unjuſt ſteward in the Goſpel for one hundred, ſet down but fifty;</hi> ſo if God for an
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170311:149"/> hundred ſtripes due to us, inflicts but fifty, nay but ten, have we not reaſon to be patient, and to ſay, <hi>He puniſheth leſſe than our iniquities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve?</hi> Labour therefore to be patient under his hand. Murmuring and repining does but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our guilt, and provoke God to double our puniſhment. The Parent takes up the child for whimpering and crying, as well as for any other fault; not patiently to let God have his will, is the way to beg another whipping from him. <hi>In patience therefore poſſeſſe thy ſoul. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaies, <hi>If the Iron be blunt, put the more ſtrength to it, Eccleſ.</hi> 10.10. So ſay I, if the affliction be ſtrong, put the more patience to it. <hi>Let patience have its perfect work</hi> (not only its half work) <hi>in thee.</hi> Patience meets God in ſuch <hi>an humble way,</hi> as diſcreet <hi>Abigail</hi> met <hi>David, let not my Lord be angry, Impatience,</hi> and <hi>fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Almighty,</hi> is juſt as if a man ſhould beat his ſhinnes againſt an iron bar; or as if he ſhould throw a ſtone againſt Heaven, that will be ſure to fall on his owne head. And further conſider the way to have what thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt, is to ſubmit to God, and lay thy ſelf at his feet: When thy ſoul is wrought to that perfect ſubmiſſion, that thou canſt truly ſay, <hi>here I am, let the Lord do with me, what ſeemeth him good; Let the Lord pleaſe himſelf, and he ſhall pleaſe me,</hi> thou haſt conquered the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of living in this world: Thou haſt got
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170311:150"/> that precious art of chimiſtry, that will extract gold out of any thing. Thou wilt be able in ſome meaſure with bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>I have learned in all eſtates to be content.</hi> O labour and pray for this happy poſture of Spirit; and that thou maiſt attain unto it, be <hi>eſpecially careful</hi> to ſecure thy <hi>intereſt in his favour,</hi> who is the great Governour of the world, and diſpoſer of all events; What a ſtrong conſolation will it be to thee, if <hi>this God</hi> be <hi>thy God, thy reconciled Father in Chriſt?</hi> thou maiſt then be aſſured <hi>all things ſhall work together for thy good.</hi> Let the wind blow from what point of the compaſſe it will, it ſhall blow thee on towards thy haven. Thou needſt not fear the bittereſt potion, if it come from the hand of a loving Father. <hi>The Cup that my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> ſaies our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 18.11. What my Father preſcribes, I have no reaſon to fear any hurt from. If God be <hi>thy Father,</hi> and thou his <hi>adopted child,</hi> th u maiſt comfort thy ſelf with this, that whatever he takes from thee, or deprives thee of, he will ſupply to thee again (as one ſaies) either in <hi>kind,</hi> or in <hi>kindneſſe;</hi> ſome way or other, he will make it up to thee. <hi>Kindneſſe</hi> is Gods <hi>ſure pay</hi> to his children: if he takes all and gives <hi>himſelf</hi> to thee, he makes thee an abundant amends. 'Tis want of Faith that we cannot find all in God.</p>
                  <p>And as this <hi>conſideration</hi> will exceedingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170311:150"/> thy mind in afflictions, ſo when God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes himſelf in a way of <hi>mercy</hi> to thee, it will exceedingly raiſe and quicken thy heart to <hi>thankfulneſs.</hi> Thou wilt give God the Glory of all his mercies. Thou wilt not <hi>ſacrifice to thine own net,</hi> to thine own <hi>wit, wiſdom, induſtry, friends,</hi> or any <hi>ſecond cauſe,</hi> (much leſſe to chance, fortune, or good luck, as ignorant people ſpeak) but thou wilt caſt the <hi>Crown of all thy mercies at his feet,</hi> humbly aſcribing all <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> unto him. He will be owned and acknowledged by thee as thy <hi>chief Lord.</hi> Thou wilt look upon thy ſelf, as holding all from him, and to be but his <hi>tenant at will,</hi> and therefore obliged to pay him <hi>his rent</hi> duly and faithfully. And what is the <hi>rent</hi> he requires of thee? but only to give him the <hi>Glory</hi> of all his mercies, and to <hi>honour</hi> him, and <hi>magnifie</hi> him, in the uſe of them. In a word, to <hi>love</hi> him, and <hi>thank</hi> him, to ſerve him, and obey him, and to walk humbly before him all thy daies.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt thing I would adviſe thee carefully to <hi>watch over</hi> is <hi>thy thoughts.</hi> Be very careful, not to lodge, or entertain any ſinfull thoughts in thy mind: Sinful thoughts are the <hi>Reubens,</hi> the <hi>firſt-born</hi> of <hi>originall ſin,</hi> and the beginning of its ſtrength. They exceedingly defile the ſoul, and are the firſt <hi>movers</hi> to evil, and very abominable in the ſight of God. Oh what reaſon have we to be humbled for the <hi>vain, wanton, fooliſh, proud, wrathful, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, blaſphemous, idle, uſeleſs, unconcerning</hi> thoughts that do many times annoy us.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore conſider of ſome remedies againſt ſinfull thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Settle in thy mind a ſtrong and deep ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods <hi>Omni-preſence,</hi> and <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> and over-awe <hi>thy thoughts</hi> with this, that they are all ſeen, and obſerved, and taken notice of by him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember, that though in the worlds wicked proverb, <hi>thoughts are free;</hi> becauſe man cannot diſcern them, nor puniſh them, yet they are not free from <hi>Gods obſervation,</hi> nor from <hi>his Law,</hi> which being ſpiritual, blndes
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170311:155"/> the thoughts of the heart, as well as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; nor from <hi>his Juſtice,</hi> which will call us to account for our ſinful thoughts, nor <hi>from the rebukes and ſcourgings of an awakened Conſcience;</hi> which are no ſmall puniſhments.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let it be thy care to ſuppreſſe, and cruſh <hi>bad thoughts</hi> at the very <hi>firſt riſing:</hi> Do not at all conſent, or comply with them; but abhor, and abandon them preſently, and cry out unto the Lord for help againſt them: Take heed of repreſenting, or acting ſin in thy thoughts. If thou wouldſt keep thy ſoul <hi>pure,</hi> beware of <hi>ſpeculative ſinfulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be carefull to have a ſtock of <hi>good materials</hi> alwaies in readineſſe for thy thoughts to work upon. Have ſome <hi>good ſubjects</hi> ready to preſent and offer to thy mind, to entertain thy thoughts with. <hi>A good man hath a good treaſure in his heart, out of which he bringeth forth good things,</hi> Mat. 12.35. Let thy mind therefore have alwaies ſome <hi>good heads</hi> to meditate on: As the <hi>evil and danger of ſin, the neceſſity of converſion; thy abſolute need of Chriſt; the vanity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the ſhortneſſe and uncertainty of this life; the everlaſtingneſs of thy future ſtate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Avoid <hi>Idleneſſe,</hi> and allow not thy ſelf in <hi>melancholy.</hi> If thou doſt not employ thy mind about that <hi>which is good,</hi> it will buſie it ſelf <hi>about evil:</hi> The mind of man if it be not <hi>well emploied,</hi> will be ranging, and roving all over
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170311:155"/> the world, and will be intent on things it ſhould not. The ſpirit of man is <hi>active,</hi> and <hi>reſtleſſe;</hi> 'Tis like <hi>a mill; it will be either grinding of that which is put into it, or elſe working upon it ſelf, wearing, and wearying it ſelf in fooliſh, fruitleſs, and unconcerning thoughts. Idleneſſe</hi> is a grand occaſion of impure and impertinent thoughts: 'Tis the devils hour, in which he takes advantage to fill and defile mans mind with wicked ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions; and <hi>melancholy</hi> diſpoſeth the mind to <hi>ſtrange, abſurd, incoherent, unreaſonable ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations;</hi> to many ſad, perplexing, afflicting thoughts. <hi>Man diſquieteth himſelf in vain,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.6. framing many imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary evils and grievances to himſelf, which God hath not really laid upon him.</p>
                  <p>Let it be thy care therefore to keep thy mind well employed, either in the <hi>duties of Piety,</hi> or the <hi>works of thy particular calling.</hi> When thou doſt relax thy mind at any time, from being <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on ſerious things, for thy neceſſary refreſhment,</hi> be careful to allow thy ſelf <hi>onely in innocent cheerfulneſſe;</hi> When <hi>the loines of thy mind are ungirt,</hi> and thy thoughts let looſe to run at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and have not <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſet over them as a <hi>Governour,</hi> thou art in great danger of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Do not cumber thy ſelf with too much worldly buſineſſe, <hi>that</hi> will overcharge thy mind with <hi>ſolicitude,</hi> and force too many earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170311:156"/> thoughts upon it: it will fill thee with <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting, diſturbing thoughts,</hi> and <hi>torturing cares.</hi> When <hi>Martha was careful, and troubled about many things,</hi> ſhe neglected the <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> Luke 10.41, 42.</p>

                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p n="9">9. Beg of God to <hi>new mould</hi> thy mind, and to put it into ſuch an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>heavenly frame,</hi> that it may be fit to produce good thoughts, as a good tree doth bring forth good fruit. Beg that <hi>Grace may be the Law of thy mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Oh how vile are we, if one member be guilty of ſo much ſin!</hi> Not without reaſon therefore hath St. <hi>James</hi> in his third Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 6. deſcribed an <hi>evil Tongue,</hi> to be a <hi>fire,</hi> a <hi>world of iniquity, and ſet on fire of Hell, i. e.</hi> from the Devil the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies, malice, and virulency. They that nouriſh an evil tongue, nouriſh that which comes from Hell, and which will carry them thither, without ſerious, and timely repentance. <hi>The tongue can no man tame,</hi> as he goes on, <hi>v.</hi> 8. that is, of <hi>himſelf</hi> without the concurrence of <hi>Divine Grace.</hi> Pray therefore for this Grace, that thou maiſt <hi>take heed to thy words, that thou offend not with thy tongue.</hi> And for the better regulating and governing of it, obſerve theſe Directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Begin at thy heart, if thou wouldſt rightly govern thy tongue. Pray as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34. <hi>The diſorders of the tongue, uſually proceed from the diſtempers of the heart.</hi> Idleneſſe of words, from vanity of thoughts; Raſhneſſe of ſpeech, from haſtineſſe of Spirit: Boaſting, and proud brags, from pride of heart; Reviling, and open reproaching, from inward malice. <hi>The foul ſtomack betraies it ſelfe, in a ſtinking breath.</hi> The naughtineſſe of the heart vents it ſelf by the tongue. A heart ſtor'd with
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170311:163"/> wiſdom and grace will diſcover it ſelf in ſavoury diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let thy end and aim in ſpeaking be, to glorifie God, and to do good to others. That word is an idle word, and utterly loſt, which tends to no good purpoſe. <hi>Either ſpeak ſomthing better than ſilence, or keep ſilence,</hi> ſaies the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poet. Chooſe either to ſpeak that which is (ſome way or other) profitable; or to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Now there may be a ſinfull ſilence, as in theſe caſes.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Conſider before thou ſpeakeſt, and be not raſh with thy mouth; <hi>Be ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Jam.</hi> Chap. 1. v. 19. <hi>i. e. deliberate, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Let thy mind be thy tongues guide.</hi> When thy words are once out of thy mouth, they are paſt recal. And therefore one ſet a pretty moral pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure over his table (a place uſually of too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170311:163"/> diſcourſe) of a man out of whoſe mouth many little birds flew (which were his words) which he with both his hands ſtrove to catch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but could not: Conſider therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſpeakeſt, and ere thy words be gone out of thy reach and power; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before thou promiſeſt any thing: Conſider whether the thing be <hi>good, fit, convenient,</hi> and <hi>in thy power,</hi> and <hi>whether thy mind will ſuffer thee to do it or no:</hi> He that does not this, will be apt to erre, and to enſnare himſelf by his owne words.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whatever thou haſt covenanted, agreed, or promiſed, be carefull to perform, though to thy loſſe and damage. If thou findeſt thy ſelf unable to perform, give notice betimes, and crave either <hi>forbearance,</hi> or a <hi>releaſe.</hi> 'Tis a good caution that one gives, <hi>that we ſhould be exceeding careful what vowes we make to God, or what promiſes to man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Be ſure, that whatever thou ſpeakeſt, be morally true; (<hi>i. e.</hi> that there be an ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Speak with a great deal of <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>warineſſe,</hi> where thou art <hi>aggrieved,</hi> and doſt think <hi>thou ſuffereſt:</hi> Truſt not thy ſelf, if there
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170311:164"/> be any the leaſt <hi>touch of ill will,</hi> or <hi>envy</hi> in thee, towards the perſon ſpoken of. <hi>Ill will never ſpeaks well.</hi> Under ſenſe of wrong, our mindes are apt to run into very uncharitable imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Forbear altogether to ſpeak when thou art <hi>in paſſion.</hi> He that is in a high fit of paſſion, is as truly drunk, as he whoſe head is full of wine. <hi>Paſſion is a bad counſellour, and as ill a ſpeaker:</hi> Moſes <hi>when in paſſion ſpake unadviſedly with his lips,</hi> Pſal. 106.33. Job <hi>curſed the day of his Nativity,</hi> Job. 3.2.3. Jonah <hi>ſpake pettiſhly againſt God himſelf,</hi> Jonah 4.9.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Deal with anothers good name as thou wouldſt be willing thine own ſhould be dealt with; be very wary of ſpeaking of the <hi>credit</hi> of others on <hi>bare reports. A good name is better than riches,</hi> Prov. 22.1. Poſſibly thou abhorreſt to <hi>ſteal</hi> from thy neighbour, or be thought a <hi>thief;</hi> do not then <hi>rob</hi> him of his <hi>good name,</hi> which is more percious than worldly ſubſtance. <hi>By a good name many have done good after their death: by the loſſe of it many have been rendred uſeleſs while they lived.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Be not <hi>ſevere-ſpirited,</hi> and apt to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret every thing in the worſt ſenſe. <hi>Let charity have its perfect work. 'Tis better to erre ten times in a way of charity, than once in a way of cruelty. Goodneſs is leaſt ſuſpitious:</hi> Gracious hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect moſt upon themſelves; they do not ſeek
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170311:164"/> ſo much what to reprove in others, as what to amend in themſelves; they love to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and being ſenſible of their own failings, are tender in reflecting on the weakneſſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: whereas thoſe that are moſt inquiſitive into the lives of others, are uſually moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in reforming their owne. Sharp cenſurers, and reprovers, had need be very exact in their own lives; elſe in judging others they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own doom. Be not apt therefore to judge or cenſure the actions of others. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how often thou thy ſelfe haſt offended; uſe another with the ſame mercy thou wouldſt have ſhewed to thy ſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, reſtore ſuch a one in the Spirit of meekneſs, conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> They that are <hi>moſt ſpiritual,</hi> are <hi>moſt tender</hi> to ſet a fallen Chriſtian in joynt again. Conſider well therefore, before thou pronounce too hard a cenſure upon thy brother: If thou canſt not excuſe the <hi>action,</hi> yet conſider poſſibly the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was good;</hi> or it might proceed from <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or ſome <hi>violent temptation, and that thou thy ſelf maiſt ſo fall, if ſo tempted, and God do not ſuſtain thee. Bernard</hi> tels of a man, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a fallen brother, fell into a bitter weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaid, <hi>he is fallen to day, and I may fall to morrow:</hi> Therefore <hi>cheriſh an humble ſenſe of thine own frailty,</hi> and that will make thee <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:170311:165"/> towards others. And be eſpecially careful thou doſt not make the <hi>failings,</hi> and <hi>miſcarriages</hi> of others, (which ſhould be matter of <hi>grief</hi> to thee, and ſet thee upon <hi>praying</hi> for them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16.) to ſerve thee for <hi>mirth</hi> and <hi>ſport: And yet this is the uſual entertainment of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt world.</hi> But the Apoſtle tels us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6. Charity rejoyceth not in iniquity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot make the ſins and failings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, its recreation.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Do not recite <hi>jeſts</hi> made upon Scripture, or contrived out of Scripture phraſe, which can hardly be told, or heard, without leaving in the mind ſome <hi>diminution of the Majeſty, and Authority of Gods Word; the Dignity whereof all ought to maintain.</hi> Therefore 'tis ill truſting our corruptions with the bare reporting of ſuch jeſts made by wicked wits, on Scripture abuſed, for fear of the bad effects that may enſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Our tongue is our glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.8. <hi>With that we ſhould bleſſe the Lord at all times, his praiſe ſhould be continually in our mouthes,</hi> Pſal. 34 1. With <hi>that</hi> we ſhould labour to do <hi>good</hi> to others with whom we converſe. Let us not then pervert it from the right uſe. <hi>Moral infection ſpreads abroad by words, as the peſtilential doth by a corrupt breath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Speak with great modeſty, when the matter any way relates to thine own commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. <hi>A mans praiſe ſmels ſweet out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                  <p n="12">12. Speak not ill of any, except it be upon <hi>juſt occaſion,</hi> and in order to <hi>ſome good,</hi> that God may have Glory thereby, and the perſons whom thou ſpeakeſt, may be warned and admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. In ſtead of <hi>ſpeaking ill,</hi> or cenſuring thy brother, <hi>privatly admoniſh</hi> him; but do it not in a <hi>maſterly way,</hi> but in the <hi>Spirit of meekneſſe, Let love ſweeten thy words.

                  <p>Be very careful therefore of, and watchfull over all thy actions.

If ever thou wouldſt win others to Religion, thou muſt be <hi>exemplary in holineſſe</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> thy ſelf; it is a woful thing to be an <hi>offence,</hi> and <hi>ſtumbling block</hi> to others, and to be an occaſion of keeping them off from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the waies of God.

If <hi>Auguſtus</hi> could ſay, <hi>an Emperor ſhould not only be free from crimes, but the very ſuſpition of them:</hi> How much more ſhould true Chriſtians labour to be ſuch, <hi>who are commanded to abſtain from all appearance of evil?</hi> 1 Theſ. 5, 22. Do nothing therefore that is misbecomming a real Chriſtian. As <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> once ſaid, <hi>ſhall ſuch a man as I flee? Nehem.</hi> 6.11. So do thou reflect upon thy ſelf, when tempted to any evil action: <hi>Shall ſuch an one as I, lie, ſwear, deal deceitfully; be proud, be covetous, be earthly minded,</hi> &amp;c? O! if ever thou ſhouldſt be overcome with ſuch things, thou maiſt ſay to thy ſelf <hi>truly,</hi> what <hi>Michal</hi> ſaid <hi>falſely</hi> to <hi>David, Thou haſt made thy ſelf like one of the vile and baſe ones of the earth.</hi>

                  <p>That therefore thou maiſt be the more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly watchful over all thy actions take theſe three directions.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Look carefully to the <hi>principle, the ſpring, the riſe</hi> of them. Obſerve from whence all thy <hi>external obedience flowes:</hi> Does it come from an <hi>inward principle of Grace, from a ſanctified heart, from a new Nature, from a principle of Faith, and Love?</hi> or from <hi>external motives,</hi> and <hi>outward reſpects</hi> and <hi>conſiderations?</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>matter</hi> that makes the <hi>work good,</hi> but the <hi>principle:</hi> Some things may be done <hi>(for the matter good)</hi> and ſome external obedience performed by meer <hi>natural men,</hi> and that either <hi>for credit,</hi> or upon the impulſes <hi>of natural Conſcience,</hi> out of <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> and <hi>a ſervile frame of ſpirit;</hi> like fruits that are ripened by art and force, not naturally and kindly; but 'tis not enough to do actions <hi>good and juſt as to the matter,</hi> but we muſt do them out of <hi>love to God,</hi> and <hi>obedience to his will,</hi> and <hi>in Faith</hi> expecting our reward from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Look to thy rule. Is the Word of God the rule and ſquare of thy actions? <hi>Thy Word is a light to my feet, and a lanthorn to my paths,</hi> ſaies <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.105. <hi>And as many as walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God,</hi> ſaies <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 6.16. Many people watch in a <hi>diſorderly way;</hi> They have no <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi> but their own <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>corrupt wills;</hi> no <hi>guide,</hi> but their own <hi>blind paſſions</hi> and <hi>humours.</hi> But if thou wouldſt order thy actions aright, take the <hi>Word of God</hi> for thy <hi>Rule.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Look to thy <hi>aim</hi> and <hi>end.</hi> Thy main and ultimate <hi>end</hi> muſt be <hi>Gods Glory.</hi> A Chriſtians whole life ſhould be a <hi>living unto God,</hi> Gal. 2.19. All that is done, be it an act of <hi>Piety, Juſtice, Temperance,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> it ſhould be done with this <hi>aim,</hi> that <hi>God might be glorified</hi> thereby.

                  <p n="1">1. Labour to be well-grounded in the truth Let the <hi>foundation</hi> be laid ſure, elſe the building with every ruffling wind, will be apt to totter. Ungrounded Chriſtians who never underſtood the true grounds of the <hi>Religion</hi> they have taken up, and how it is <hi>built on the Scriptures,</hi> when they meet with Arguments againſt it, which they never heard of before, and which they (through their unskilfulneſs) cannot anſwer; <hi>they</hi> preſently yield to errour; and think, becauſe <hi>they</hi> cannot anſwer them, therefore no body elſe can. But if thou wouldſt not be <hi>carried away with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind of Doctrine,</hi> Labour rightly to underſtand
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170311:175"/> the true grounds of Chriſtian Religion: And to this end <hi>ſtudy the Scriptures, with humility,</hi> and be much in <hi>prayer,</hi> that God would guide thee by his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> into all ſaving truth, and keep thee from falling into errour. And <hi>remember,</hi> that <hi>what has been commonly received by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God and embraced and practiſed by the Saints in all ages, is not lightly to be rejected and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Can any rational man think, God would leave the <hi>generality of his people</hi> to errour and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of mind?

                  <p n="2">2. Reſt not in a <hi>bare knowledge</hi> of the truth, but reduce thy <hi>knowledge</hi> into practiſe. Be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in the Religion thou profeſſeſt, and let the <hi>truths</hi> of God, like <hi>leaven,</hi> ſeaſon thy mind, will, and affections, and have a powerful influence on thy life. When men are in love with <hi>Goſpel-truths,</hi> for the goodneſſe, ſweetneſſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they <hi>taſt</hi> in them, they will labour to hold them faſt. Thoſe that have any experience <hi>in their own hearts</hi> of the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Doctrines of <hi>Repentance, Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>daily watchfulneſs,</hi> will not eaſily <hi>throw them off,</hi> and exchange them for <hi>new opinions:</hi> But they that care not to <hi>practiſe</hi> the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>neceſsary
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170311:176"/> truths</hi> of the Goſpel, <hi>no wonder</hi> if they prove <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> and fall off from them. Labour therefore to practiſe the <hi>truths</hi> thou profeſſeſt, holding the myſtery of Faith in a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. The more thou <hi>groweſt in Grace,</hi> the more thou ſhalt be kept from falling <hi>into the errour of the wicked, Heb.</hi> 13.9.

Happineſſe doth not <hi>lie</hi> in the meer <hi>knowing</hi> or <hi>aſſenting</hi> to the principles of Chriſtian Religion, but in <hi>living</hi> according to them, and expreſſing the power and efficacy of them in our lives.

A <hi>right belief</hi> ſhould have a powerful influence on the heart and life: But they whoſe hearts are rotten and deceitfull <hi>under truth,</hi> 'tis no wonder if they be deceived by <hi>errour.</hi> Believe it, if the heart be <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>love ſin,</hi> it will eaſily encline a man to <hi>entertain</hi> ſuch <hi>corrupt principles</hi> as will give <hi>liberty to</hi> ſin. <hi>Men would fain have that true which is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate to their corrupt intereſts.</hi> Take heed therefore of harbouring any <hi>ſecret luſt</hi> or <hi>ſin</hi> in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170311:176"/> thy heart. 'Tis <hi>ſin</hi> provokes God to <hi>give men up</hi> to errour; God does <hi>many times</hi> out of a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret judgment</hi> ſuffer <hi>thoſe</hi> to fall into <hi>errour,</hi> who held the <hi>truth in unrighteouſneſſe.

Take heed of pride, conceitedneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thine own judgment and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>The humble God will teach, but he reſiſts the proud,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.

                     <hi>Whoſo endureth to the end,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Matth. 10.22. <hi>he and he only ſhall be ſaved.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170311:184"/> interceſſion for them;</hi> and alſo <hi>by a continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the Spirit, maintaining the eſſence, life and ſeed of Grace in them; ſo that they ſhall neither totally nor finally fall away.</hi> Yet obſerve theſe four things. 1. <hi>Seeming Grace may be lost; Take from him that which he hath, Mat.</hi> 25.28. In <hi>Luke</hi> 'tis, <hi>Take from him, that which he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have,</hi> Chap. 8. v. 18. <hi>Blazing Comets, and Meteors are ſoon ſpent, and fall from Heaven, while true Stars keep their Orbe and Station.</hi> 2. <hi>The common work of the Spirit may fail:</hi> Such as is ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. viz. <hi>Illumination, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reformation, temporary Faith, a ſlight taſt of the comforts of the Goſpel, a weak glance upon the Glory of Heaven,</hi> which may poſſibly ſtir up ſuch a wiſh as was in <hi>Balaam, O that I might die the death of the righteous;</hi> Nay further, there may be a <hi>partaking of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, i.e.</hi> of abilities for holy duties, (though not of <hi>his renewing Graces</hi>) And yet ſuch plenty of bloſſoms as here are, may ſomtimes be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit. 3. <hi>True Grace</hi> may ſuffer a ſhrewd decay; the leaves may fail, though there may remain ſome life in the root: We read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>decay</hi> both of <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Some left <hi>their firſt Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.12. Others left <hi>their firſt Love, Rev.</hi> 2.4. And as for <hi>obedience,</hi> we read of <hi>the firſt waies of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, as diſtinguiſhed <hi>from his latter,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.3. becauſe <hi>David</hi> in his latter time fell into
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170311:184"/> 
                     <hi>ſcandalous ſins.</hi> In temptations, Gods children may be ſorely ſhaken: Their heel may be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as Chriſts was, though their head be not cruſhed. The <hi>operations of Grace</hi> may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for a time; and yet a ſeed remain, as in the caſe of <hi>David.</hi> 4. <hi>True Grace,</hi> if <hi>left to us,</hi> would ſoon be loſt. <hi>Adam</hi> ſhewed a ſad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this in innocency: But the beſt is, our <hi>ſecurity</hi> lies in Gods <hi>power</hi> and <hi>promiſes,</hi> and <hi>our union with Chriſt</hi> (as was ſaid before) not in our <hi>own ſtrength.</hi> Chriſt hath a charge to keep the Saints <hi>ſafe,</hi> and to conduct them ſafe to everlaſting Glory, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh,</hi> &amp;c. v. 29. <hi>My Father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand; I and my Father are one.</hi> God and Chriſt are engaged in the keeping of them. But obſerve it; Thoſe whom God cauſes to <hi>perſevere,</hi> he makes to perſevere in the <hi>uſe</hi> of meanes, as 'twas in their caſe. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.31. <hi>All ſhall come to land; but except ye abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſafe.</hi> No <hi>believer</hi> is ſo ſure of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in a ſtate of Grace, as that he needeth not be very wary, and watchful, and jealous over himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, take heed leſt he fall. There is a fear of cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as a fear of diffidence and diſtruſt,</hi> 'tis good to weaken and abate the ſecurity of <hi>our fleſh,</hi> though not our confidence in Chriſt. Our
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170311:185"/> Saviour had prayed that <hi>Peters Faith ſhould not fail,</hi> yet together with the other Apoſtles, he bids <hi>him</hi> watch. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.40, 46. <hi>The fear of God is a preſerving Grace,</hi> Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me.</hi> This fear will make us <hi>watchful, not diffident of Gods power and goodneſs.</hi> And in this ſenſe, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwaies,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. And as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our adviſeth, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.46. <hi>that watcheth and prayeth, that he enter not into temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee then that to <hi>perſeverance</hi> there is a concurrence of our <hi>care</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> required, Jude v. 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God.</hi> &amp; Phil. 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling for it is God that worketh in you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the <hi>main</hi> work is Gods; he is the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner,</hi> and he is the <hi>perfecter, Phil.</hi> 1 6. He is the <hi>author,</hi> and he is the <hi>finiſher, Heb.</hi> 12.2. But may <hi>we</hi> then be <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>ſit ſtill,</hi> be <hi>careleſs</hi> and <hi>negligent?</hi> No, in no wiſe: For God worketh <hi>in us,</hi> and <hi>by us.</hi> If therefore there be <hi>no Grace</hi> working <hi>in us,</hi> nor working <hi>by us,</hi> and <hi>exciting, and quickning, and enabling us to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience,</hi> and a careful and watchful carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards God, we may juſtly ſuſpect our <hi>ſtate</hi> for the preſent to be very <hi>bad. A Chriſtians life is never exempted from care.</hi> We muſt be watchful and diligent to the very laſt: Satan is alwaies buſie; we have <hi>corruptions within,</hi> and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170311:185"/> the <hi>world</hi> is full of ſnares: And many times, where there ſeems to be leaſt danger, there is moſt cauſe of fear. <hi>Lot</hi> that was <hi>chaſt</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> miſcarried in the <hi>mountaines,</hi> where there were none but his own Family. <hi>David's</hi> example may warn the holieſt perſons to the worlds end, to be jealous over themſelves. Who would have thought that <hi>he (whoſe heart ſmote him for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the lap of Sauls garment)</hi> ſhould after fall into <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> and <hi>murder? Peter</hi> alſo is a ſad inſtance of <hi>confidence</hi> in a mans own ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Upon all theſe <hi>conſiderations,</hi> let me adviſe thee to <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>watch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> Haſt thou <hi>begun</hi> to make profeſſion of Religion?

                  <p>I ſhall conclude this <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>watchfulneſſe,</hi> and this whole Chapter <hi>of maintaining a daily cloſe communion with God,</hi> with two further <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> which (with Gods bleſſing) will much conduce to the carrying on of the whole work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Direction</hi> 1. Inure thy ſoul, (beſides thy daily ſolemn prayers) to ſend up <hi>frequent, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ejaculatory prayers</hi> unto God. Theſe holy
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170311:186"/> 
                     <hi>liftings up</hi> of the heart unto the Lord, as they are very <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him, ſo they are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>advantageous</hi> for the fetching ſpeedy <hi>aid</hi> from Heaven, for the <hi>quenching of a luſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a temptation, the better performing any ſervice,</hi> delivering <hi>us out of any preſent ſtraits, enabling us to bear any affliction, or in caſe of any failing, to beg mercy and pardon ſpeedily, while the heart is ſmitten, and tenderly affected with a ſenſe of its miſcarriage:</hi> As when <hi>Davids</hi> heart <hi>ſmote him for numbring the people,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.10. we find him lifting up his heart unto the Lord, in this manner, <hi>I have ſinned, I beſeech thee take away the iniquity of thy ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>ejaculatory prayers</hi> are (as it were) <hi>meſſengers</hi> ſent <hi>poſt</hi> to Heaven, (when time is not afforded for continued prayer) for ſome ſpeedy help. And as they hinder no buſineſſe, but (being duly performed) <hi>further</hi> it much every way, ſo no buſineſſe can hinder them. When a Miniſter is preaching, and finds his heart <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>liveleſſe</hi> in the ſervice, or when in <hi>ſolemn prayer</hi> he finds his <hi>ſpirit indiſpoſed, dry,</hi> and <hi>barren;</hi> How may he ſpeed one of theſe <hi>ſwift</hi> and <hi>ſilent meſsengers,</hi> one of theſe fervent ejaculations to Heaven, for help and aſſiſtance? When a Chriſtian is hearing the Word, of how much advantage is it, to ſend up ſuch ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and fervent prayers, that God would ſet home <hi>ſuch</hi> or <hi>ſuch</hi> a Doctrine upon his heart; or
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170311:186"/> help him to forſake ſuch a ſin, then reproved; or enable him to believe, and embrace ſuch a Truth? When Chriſt was preaching to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that <hi>hard leſson</hi> of brotherly forgiveneſs, we find in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Luke, v.</hi> 5. They ſent up that holy ejaculation, <hi>Lord encreaſe our Faith.</hi> A man that is <hi>riding,</hi> or <hi>walking,</hi> or employed in his lawful calling, may thus <hi>converſe with Heaven,</hi> and yet no waies hinder his preſent buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>And further to perſwade thee to the practiſe of this direction, conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Theſe ejaculatory prayers do very much honour God; in that they acknowledge him, to be a God, that can underſtand the language of <hi>our hearts,</hi> and the leaſt movings of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, towards him; and that he is a <hi>God hearing prayers,</hi> and <hi>a very preſent help in time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. They are a good means to keep our hearts <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> and in a good frame. <hi>Strangeneſſe</hi> often growes between God and our ſoules, for want of theſe. And many <hi>affecting providences</hi> looſe their <hi>kindly work</hi> upon us for want of a preſent lifting up of our hearts in ſome ſutable ejaculations.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. They are a ſpecial means to fit us for more <hi>ſolemn prayer.</hi> We muſt begin duties with duties: God <hi>prepares</hi> the hearts of his people, to pray <hi>acceptably</hi> unto him, by theſe preparatory ejaculations.</p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:170311:187"/>
                  <p>But here obſerve theſe few cautions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed of <hi>formality, ſlightneſs;</hi> and <hi>cuſtomarineſs</hi> in them. Let them be <hi>ſerious,</hi> and <hi>fervent,</hi> and <hi>from thy heart.</hi> Nothing more <hi>uſual</hi> with many peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le, than <hi>God forgive me, Lord bleſſe me, God help me,</hi> when the <hi>heart</hi> is nothing <hi>affected;</hi> nor does it ſend up theſe as <hi>earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts</hi> unto the Lord, looking for an anſwer.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170311:187"/> himſelf when he created the world, every day looked over his own works. Surely God had no need to examine his works that were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and perfect; but 'tis written for our <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> that we ſhould do ſo likewiſe. Therefore for the keeping thy <hi>Conſcience clear from guilt,</hi> it will be very requiſite, thou ſhouldſt <hi>take thy ſelf in private,</hi> before thou lieſt down to ſleep, and conſider thy whole carriage and behaviour that day; that ſo thou maiſt by a ſerious humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, retract and undo whatever has been amiſſe, and maiſt make all ſtreight between God and thy ſoul.

                  <p n="1">I. We find <hi>a Sabbath</hi> inſtituted by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>the beginning,</hi> Gen. 2.2, 3. <hi>And on the ſeventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his work which he had made, and God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it, becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his work, which God created and made.</hi> Before we read of the <hi>fall of Adam,</hi> we read of a <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> bleſſed and ſanctified by God himſelf: God bleſſed <hi>the ſeventh day,</hi> that is, diſpenſed a <hi>peculiar favour</hi> towards it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted <hi>that day</hi> above the reſt; which is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the next words, <hi>he ſanctified it,</hi> that is, <hi>he ſeparated and conſecrated it to his own holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and annexed a bleſſing to the obſervation of it. Adam</hi> did not need a <hi>day</hi> of reſt <hi>in innocency,</hi> by reaſon of any <hi>bodily wearineſſe</hi> that would have betided him upon his <hi>ſix daies</hi> labour in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of husbandry; yet God ſaw it <hi>convenient</hi> to enjoyn him to ſet apart <hi>one</hi> day in <hi>ſeven,</hi> to enjoy more <hi>eſpecial communion</hi> with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Now if <hi>Adam in innocency</hi> (when he had no ſin in him) had need of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170311:190"/> take him off from the works of his calling, that he might converſe with God (more immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>in holy duties,</hi> and <hi>exerciſes:</hi> How much more <hi>need</hi> have <hi>we</hi> in this <hi>corrupt</hi> eſtate, who are ſo prone to ſin, and had need of all <hi>helps</hi> againſt it? Well then, we find in <hi>the very beginning,</hi> that the Law <hi>concerning the Sabbath</hi> was given while the <hi>whole Nature</hi> of mankind was in <hi>our firſt Parents,</hi> even <hi>before</hi> they fell. <hi>They</hi> might have lived here on the earth <hi>without ſin,</hi> but they were not to live <hi>without a Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the fall, when <hi>Enos</hi> was born of <hi>Seth,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>then men began to call on the Name of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 4. ult. That is, (as I take it) <hi>to call upon his Name in publick Aſſemblies:</hi> And moſt like it is, the day they obſerved was the <hi>ſame</hi> that <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> obſerved <hi>before them,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs <hi>after them;</hi> Namely, <hi>that day of the week,</hi> in which God himſelf reſted, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the great work of the worlds <hi>creation: Even before the Law</hi> (ſaith learned <hi>Mercer</hi> upon <hi>Gen.) I doubt not but this day by Gods teaching, was ſolemn and ſacred to thoſe primitive Fathers.

                  <p n="5">V. Well, our Saviour is <hi>aſcended.</hi> Let us now ſee what <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>holy Ghoſt (whom he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <p n="6">VI.

For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>times of perſecution,</hi> before any, either <hi>Imperial Edict,</hi> or <hi>Canon of Council</hi> enjoyned it, the <hi>obſervation</hi> of <hi>this day</hi> was ſo taken notice of by the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that it became a conſtant <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory</hi> to the Chriſtians in their examining, <hi>Have you kept the Lords day?</hi> To which their anſwer was ever ready, <hi>I cannot intermit it, for I am a Chriſtian, and the law of God prompts me to it,</hi> Baron. 30.3. Memb. 5.</p>
                  <p>Now if any man ſhall enquire <hi>how the Sabbath came to be tranſlated into the Lords day.</hi> I anſwer, Chriſt in the <hi>fourty daies</hi> he ſtaied upon the earth after his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> did <hi>ſundry times</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to his Diſciples, <hi>teaching them the things appertaining to the Kingdome of God, Acts</hi> 1.3. Therefore 'tis probable the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed</hi> by Chriſt concerning the change of <hi>the day</hi> (from the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> to the <hi>eighth</hi>) and had ſpecial order <hi>immediatly</hi> from himſelf, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. 'Tis evident Chriſt is Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.27. And therefore had power
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170311:194"/> not only to abrogate the old Sabbath, but to ſurrogate and ſubſtitute the new in its room. But whether this day were inſtituted <hi>immediatly by Chriſt</hi> himſelf, or <hi>by his Apoſtles,</hi> guided and infallibly <hi>inſpired</hi> by <hi>his holy Spirit,</hi> after his <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention,</hi> ſtill the day will be of <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi> And <hi>this Act</hi> of theirs will appear but the <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a particular <hi>Command</hi> from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For conſider how Chriſt ſent theſe Apoſtles; <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> John 20.21, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me,</hi> Luke 10.16. <hi>Go, Mat.</hi> 28.19. There is their miſſion. <hi>Teach all Nations,</hi> There is their Commiſſion. What? Why, <hi>What things I command you:</hi> and to aſſiſt and help you, <hi>Lo, I am with you alwaies, to the end of the world;</hi> not in <hi>corporal preſence,</hi> but <hi>by my Spirit, the Comforter whom I will ſend you,</hi> John 15.26. <hi>And he ſhall bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> John 14.26. <hi>This Spirit of Truth ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak: He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the Apoſtles were <hi>undoubtedly inſpired</hi> by the Spirit of Chriſt, who revealed his will unto them. And that they were thus acted by the holy Ghoſt, they themſelves teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in their firſt Council; It ſeemed <hi>good to the holy Ghoſt and to us, Acts</hi> 15.28.</p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:170311:195"/>
                  <p>Thus we ſee there are two things whereon the <hi>Divine right</hi> of the Lords day is <hi>founded;</hi> Upon the <hi>morality</hi> of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and upon <hi>Evangelical Inſtitution,</hi> either by Chriſt himſelf, or his Apoſtles. And <hi>what the Apoſtles delivered by the dictate of the holy Ghost, is as firm and indefeizable</hi> (ſaies <hi>Cyprian de ablut. pedum.) as what Chriſt himſelf.</hi> Our <hi>Church</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <hi>the inſtitution of this day</hi> as a <hi>weekly day</hi> to the <hi>fourth Commandement;</hi> and as the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week, ſhe foundeth it upon <hi>Apoſtolical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi> and <hi>tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this, with the words of the judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſ. Pol. Book</hi> 5. <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag.</hi> 17. <hi>We are bound,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>to account the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of one day in ſeven, a duty, which Gods immutable Law doth exact for ever; although with us, the day be changed, in regard of a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, begun by our Saviour Chriſt; yet the ſame proportion of time continueth, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by way of a perpetual homage never to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed withal, nor remitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the <hi>ſecond Particular.</hi> The <hi>manner how</hi> we ought to obſerve <hi>this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                     <hi>ſpiritual duties</hi> then required of us. The <hi>Jewes</hi> before the Sabbath had <hi>a time of preparation, Luke</hi> 23.54. Why ſhould not we?</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Take heed therefore of being found a <hi>ſlighter</hi> of thoſe duties, the <hi>neglect whereof</hi> cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with any true <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of Religion, or any <hi>due care</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> or <hi>others ſoules,</hi> that we ought to have a care of.

Can a man touch pitch, and not be defiled?</hi> ſaies the ſon of <hi>Sirach,</hi> Chap. 13.1.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods Command.</hi> God requireth if <hi>any thing</hi> be gotten either by <hi>violence, fraud,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, reſtitution</hi> ſhould be made to the <hi>true owner,</hi> Lev. 6.2. <hi>If a ſoul ſin, and commit a treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowſhip, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;</hi> V. 3. <hi>Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and ſweareth falſly, in any of all theſe that a man doth, ſinning therein:</hi> V. 4. <hi>Then it ſhall be, becauſe he hath ſinned and is guilty, that he ſhall reſtore that which he took vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the loſt thing which he found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:170311:229"/> himſelf, and brought again the thirty pieces of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the chief Prieſts and Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <hi>III. In reſpect of</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Common-wealth. <hi>A</hi> Family <hi>is the</hi> firſt ſociety, <hi>and a</hi> ſeminary of the reſt. <hi>'Tis</hi> made up <hi>of</hi> ſingle perſons <hi>in</hi> ſeveral relations: <hi>And</hi> Towns, Congregations, Cities, Countries, <hi>all are</hi> made up <hi>of ſeveral</hi> Families. Particular Families <hi>are (as it were) the</hi> hives <hi>out of which</hi> ſwarms <hi>go forth into the world. To make</hi> Families good <hi>and</hi> religious, <hi>is the way to make</hi> good Magiſtrates, good Husbands, good Wives, good Maſters, good Servants, good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

So let us labour to</hi> ſeaſon <hi>our</hi> Families <hi>with</hi> true Piety, <hi>if we would keep</hi> diſorders <hi>out</hi> of Church <hi>and</hi> State.</p>

               <p n="11">
                  <hi>11.</hi> Is there not a bleſſing promiſed to joynt-prayer, <hi>Matth. 18.19?</hi> Again I ſay unto you,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:170311:233"/> that if two of you ſhall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven; <hi>v. 20.</hi> For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <hi>12.</hi> Should not every Chriſtian Family be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Church of Chriſt? And is not a Church to pray together, <hi>Acts 12.5?</hi> Peter therefore was kept in priſon, but prayer was made without ceaſing of the Church for him. <hi>v. 12.</hi> And when he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the thing, he came to the houſe of Mary the mother of John, whoſe Sir-name was Mark, where many were gathered together, praying. <hi>Acts 2.42.</hi> And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread and in prayers.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <hi>13.</hi> Do not the neceſſities of a Family require it? They are joyn'd in mercies, in judgments, and often in ſins; Should they not therefore joyn in humiliations, prayers, and thankſgivings?</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <hi>14.</hi> Can a Family expect to be bleſſed by God, that lives in a conſtant neglect of this duty? The favour of Providence is a mans beſt inheritance. Family Piety is uſually attended with Family pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, <hi>Prov. 3.33.</hi> The curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked; but he bleſſeth the habitation of the juſt.</p>

Is there not as good fellowſhip in holy duties, as in merry company, and idle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication? Why ſhould a Family do nothing joyntly that tends to the good of their ſouls? Are we Chriſtians, and ſhall we not be willing God ſhould be the Maſter of our houſes?</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <hi>16.</hi> Does not the neglect of prayer expoſe a Family to many judgments, and many ſins?

               <p>

True love is ſoul love:</hi> And if the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> be thus <hi>grounded</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>a care of each others ſouls,</hi> it will make <hi>their lives</hi> a kind of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon earth.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis cordial, without diſſimulation.</hi> Many a man <hi>feigns love</hi> and <hi>friendſhip</hi> to others, but no body is <hi>inſincere</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> in his <hi>love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Such</hi> a <hi>love</hi> ſhould a man <hi>bear</hi> to <hi>his Wife.</hi> As <hi>Jonathans heart was knit to David,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.1. <hi>And he loved him as his own ſoul;</hi> ſo ought the <hi>Husband</hi> to <hi>love his Wife.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Charity is not eaſily provoked. True, fervent, cordial love</hi> is <hi>long ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>beareth with many infirmities</hi> and <hi>weakneſses,</hi> and <hi>covereth a multitude of offences,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis conſtant.

Certainly there will be a <hi>ſtrict account</hi> requir'd of all that <hi>deriſion, ſlanders, reproaches,</hi> and <hi>hard uſage,</hi> the <hi>faithful Ministers of Chriſt</hi> do <hi>meet with</hi> in the <hi>diſcharge</hi> of their <hi>places</hi> and <hi>calling.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be <hi>Christ</hi> that <hi>employes</hi> them, then let <hi>thoſe conſider ſeriouſly of it,</hi> who dare <hi>preſume</hi> to <hi>exerciſe the Offices</hi> of this <hi>ſacred function,</hi> without being <hi>lawfully Call'd</hi> thereto. What is <hi>this,</hi> but as if a <hi>man</hi> on <hi>his own head,</hi> ſhould go as an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> from his Prince. The Apoſtle ſaies of the <hi>Priests</hi> of the Law (which yet are <hi>inferiour</hi> to thoſe of the Goſpel) <hi>That no man takes this honour to himſelf, but he which was call'd of God, Heb.</hi> 5.4.

Who being <hi>arrogant</hi> and <hi>ambitious,</hi> would needs take upon him the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:170311:266"/> 
                  <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and <hi>he,</hi> and <hi>his accomplices riſe up againſt Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>their plea</hi> is, <hi>all the Congregation are holy, ye take too much upon you; Wherefore lift you up your ſelves above the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Lord?</hi> So that we ſee this <hi>levelling humour</hi> is no <hi>new thing</hi> in the world. To <hi>make head</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to oppoſe <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> you ſee was <hi>Corahs</hi> ſin; Take heed of <hi>imitating him,</hi> leſt <hi>you periſh likewiſe in the gainſaying of Corah,</hi> Jude v. 11. You may read the ſad end of him and his Company <hi>Num.</hi> 16.32. And <hi>ſo much</hi> of the <hi>first Duty</hi> people ought to pay to their <hi>Miniſters. They ought to love</hi> and <hi>eſteem them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They ought to pray for them,</hi> that they may be <hi>furniſhed</hi> with all <hi>thoſe Graces</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> with <hi>ſuch aſsiſtances of Gods Spirit,</hi> as may enable them to <hi>diſcharge</hi> that <hi>holy Calling faithfully</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſefully:</hi> Of this I have ſpoken more, <hi>P.</hi> 323.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>They ought conſcientiouſly to attend upon their Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>ſubmit</hi> to their <hi>Spiritual guidance</hi> and <hi>direction,</hi> really endeavouring to <hi>grow</hi> in <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> thereby. <hi>Obey them</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. Whatſoever <hi>they</hi> out of <hi>Gods Word</hi> ſhall make manifeſt to be <hi>his Will</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> is to be <hi>obeyed,</hi> ſeeing <hi>'tis not they,</hi> but <hi>God requires it,</hi> according <hi>to that of Chriſt, He
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:170311:267"/> that heareth you, heareth me,</hi> Luke 10 16. And <hi>this</hi> whether it be delivered <hi>by way of publick preaching,</hi> or <hi>private exhortation;</hi> for in <hi>both,</hi> ſo long as they keep them to the <hi>Rule,</hi> which is Gods Word, they are the <hi>meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. 2.7. People therefore muſt <hi>labour</hi> to grow in <hi>Spiritual knowledge</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> anſwerably to the <hi>means of Grace</hi> afforded them, and thereby ſtrengthen <hi>the hands,</hi> and <hi>encourage the heart</hi> of their <hi>Miniſter</hi> in his work. The <hi>profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> of the people in <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> is the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> of <hi>every Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and though <hi>God will not reward him</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> but his <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>induſtry,</hi> yet nothing more <hi>troubles</hi> him then to <hi>ſee</hi> his <hi>multiplied pains</hi> not anſwered with <hi>deſired</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Let <hi>people</hi> therefore look <hi>to it,</hi> that they bring forth the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. The <hi>Husbandman</hi> laies his ground <hi>fallow,</hi> when he ſees it will not bring forth <hi>Corn,</hi> ſo as to <hi>quit charges.</hi> The Kingdom of Heaven ſaies our Saviour, ſhall be taken away from you, and given to others which will bring forth the fruits thereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. 'Tis <hi>juſt</hi> with God to take away the <hi>means of Grace</hi> from a people, when he ſees they live <hi>unprofitably</hi> under them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Seeing <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſow <hi>Spirituals,</hi> the <hi>people</hi> ſhould not <hi>begrudge</hi> them, if they <hi>reap</hi> ſome of their <hi>temporals,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.14. <hi>God hath ordained that they that preach the Goſpel, ſhould
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:170311:267"/> live upon the Goſpel.</hi> 'Tis but <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> who by <hi>undertaking that holy Calling,</hi> are <hi>taken off</hi> from the <hi>waies</hi> of gaining a <hi>liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> towards the obtaining eternal life, <hi>'tis agreeable</hi> both to <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> they ſhould receive <hi>temporals</hi> from the people. Yet this ought not to be a Miniſters <hi>chief end</hi> and <hi>aim</hi> in <hi>ſetting his hand to this plow;</hi> but to <hi>Glorifie God</hi> in the <hi>ſaving</hi> of <hi>Souls.</hi> For what will it <hi>profit</hi> a Miniſter to <hi>gain his peoples Tithes,</hi> and by <hi>negligence</hi> and <hi>careleſneſſe to loſe his peoples Souls.

They may ſpend <hi>more time</hi> upon their <hi>ſouls</hi> than <hi>poor</hi> people can. They have more <hi>lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> (if they have <hi>hearts</hi> ſo to employ it) to <hi>attend</hi> the means of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>to work out their ſalvation.</hi> They ſhould <hi>conſider,</hi> though they are <hi>rich</hi> in <hi>this world,</hi> yet there is <hi>another world</hi> that is to be <hi>look'd</hi> after. Though they enjoy the <hi>good things</hi> of <hi>this life,</hi> yet there is <hi>a life to come</hi> which muſt be <hi>car'd</hi> for. Though they are <hi>encreaſ'd</hi> with <hi>worldly goods,</hi> yet if they have <hi>all their portion</hi> here, they are moſt miſerable. Seeing 'tis <hi>well</hi> with them <hi>here on earth,</hi> their <hi>main deſign</hi> ſhould be to <hi>ſecure their ſtate in Grace,</hi> and their <hi>title</hi> to Heaven. They ſhould <hi>above all things</hi> be careful <hi>to lay hold on eternal life. This</hi> life they cannot <hi>hold,</hi> nor their <hi>riches, eſtates,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> here: They ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>lay hold</hi> on <hi>that</hi> which they may <hi>hold,</hi> and which will never fail them. They ſhould be <hi>ſo wiſe</hi> as to take the <hi>right courſe</hi> to be <hi>heirs of the
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:170311:281"/> Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that when they muſt <hi>bid farewell</hi> to this life, and their eſtates here, they may enter upon that <hi>glorious</hi> inheritance. And yet <hi>ſtrange it is to ſee</hi> how this <hi>one thing abſolutely neceſſary</hi> is neglected by <hi>far the greater part</hi> of them that are <hi>rich</hi> in this world. In thoſe places where <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> are found (they ſay) there groweth neither <hi>graſſe</hi> nor <hi>plant,</hi> nor other thing that is any thing worth. Many <hi>rich</hi> mens <hi>hearts</hi> are as barren of <hi>true Piety,</hi> as thoſe countries are of graſſe: <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>ſuch,</hi> ſaies, Chap. 21.13. <hi>They ſpend their daies in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</hi> v. 14. <hi>Therefore they ſay unto God depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy waies.</hi> v. 15. <hi>What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> 'Tis grown almoſt into a Proverb, <hi>a little Religion goes far in a rich man or Gentleman.</hi> How do ſuch perſons uſually <hi>bleſs</hi> themſelves in a <hi>few formal outward performances</hi> of religious duties? And if they live not in the <hi>groſſe defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>pollutions</hi> of the world, but are of a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>civil</hi> converſation <hi>as to men,</hi> how eaſily can they <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with themſelves from <hi>engaging</hi> in the <hi>ſtricter</hi> and more <hi>ſerious</hi> parts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Nay, thoſe things wherein the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> conſiſts, are (too often) <hi>matter</hi> of their <hi>ſcorn;</hi> and <hi>ſlighted</hi> and <hi>neglected</hi> by them as <hi>more ado</hi> than needs. And thus it
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:170311:282"/> often happens that they that have <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of eſtate, have <hi>leanneſſe</hi> of ſoul, as 'tis, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15. And they that are <hi>well provided</hi> for in this life, take no <hi>due care</hi> to <hi>provide</hi> for <hi>eternity,</hi> not to <hi>lay up for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. They that ſhould be <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> to thoſe among whom they live, and by their <hi>power, wealth</hi> and <hi>greatneſſe</hi> ſhould <hi>countenance</hi> and <hi>promote</hi> the <hi>power of Godlineſſe,</hi> prove many times the greateſt <hi>diſcouragers</hi> of it. <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved this as a <hi>ſore evil under the Sun,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.13. <hi>Riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</hi> And not only for their <hi>hurt,</hi> but the <hi>hurt</hi> of <hi>many others</hi> round about them. Many could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſuch <hi>great ſinners,</hi> and <hi>diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of God, if they had not had <hi>ſo great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. They ought to be <hi>exceeding thankful</hi> unto God. The <hi>more</hi> God hath beſtowed upon them, the <hi>greater</hi> is their <hi>debt</hi> of thankfulneſſe, and the <hi>greater</hi> is their <hi>duty</hi> of obedience. If the Lord hath <hi>lifted them up,</hi> if he hath <hi>ſhined upon their Tabernacle,</hi> and <hi>given them power to get wealth,</hi> as 'tis, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.28.

'Tis reported of <hi>one of the Kings of France,</hi> that he was wont to ſay, <hi>that many thouſands</hi> (no doubt) <hi>were born on the ſame day he was, yet not one of them born to be a King but himſelf;</hi> which he <hi>noted</hi> as a <hi>free favour</hi> of Divine Providence to <hi>him,</hi> in that <hi>he</hi> was born to the <hi>Honour</hi> and Happineſſe of a Kingdom, when <hi>at the ſame time,</hi> many <hi>others</hi> were born to <hi>mean conditions; ſome</hi> poſſibly to <hi>beggery</hi> and <hi>want.</hi> 'Tis God alone that <hi>ſets up one,</hi> and <hi>puls down another.</hi> He gives <hi>power, riches,</hi> and <hi>eſtate</hi> to <hi>one</hi> man, and ſets <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi> in a mean condition. And therefore thoſe whom he is pleaſed to bleſſe with a <hi>rightful poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion</hi> of riches, ſhould be <hi>exceeding thankful,</hi> and conſtantly <hi>remember</hi> who hath made them (in this) to <hi>differ from others.</hi> Gods <hi>impoſt</hi> on all his bleſſings is <hi>thankfulneſſe.</hi> If we neglect to pay this <hi>impoſt,</hi> the <hi>commodity</hi> is <hi>forfeit.</hi> God can quickly <hi>blow upon and blaſt all our bleſſings, if we be unthankful,</hi> as 'tis, Mal. 2.2. <hi>If ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give Glory unto my Name, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I will even ſend a curſe upon you, and will curſe your bleſſings,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p n="3">III. They ought to be <hi>exceeding humble.
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:170311:283"/> Charge them</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>that they be not high minded.</hi> Of moſt men, the Proverb is true, <hi>Their good and their blood riſes together.</hi> Proſperity is to many a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>intoxication,</hi> it makes their heads giddy.

And yet if the matter be well conſidered, what <hi>little reaſon</hi> have <hi>rich</hi> men to be proud? Have they not <hi>all</hi> as <hi>ſtewards,</hi> and therefore ſhould be thinking <hi>how to make their accounts,</hi> rather than <hi>pride themſelves in their receipts?</hi> Does not God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf (very frequently in Scripture) the <hi>proud</hi> mans profeſſed enemy? <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>He reſiſteth the proud,</hi> Prov. 6.16. <hi>A proud look is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Pride and arrogancy do I hate.</hi> And <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction.</hi> And he that has ſo <hi>great an enemy</hi> as <hi>God</hi> engaged aginſt him, is like to <hi>ſmart</hi> for it to purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV.

Certainly (as a late Author ſaies well) <hi>One plain Coat put upon a poor mans back, will better become a wealthy man, than twenty rich ones put on his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V.

Here (poſſibly) with all your labour, you cannot raiſe your ſelves to any conſiderable eſtates. He would be a welcome man unto you, that could direct you how in an honeſt and juſt way, by uſing due care and induſtry, you might attain a hundred pounds a year, How diligently would you liſten to his advice, and how earneſtly and punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Directions? Now therefore come on, and conſider ſeriouſly, whether it will not be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream folly and madneſſe in you (having ſo golden
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:170311:290"/> an opportunity in your hands of attaining (not ſoſmal a matter as a hundred pounds a year) but a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a glorious and never-fading Kingdom) to continue in your ignorance, ſtubbornneſſe, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ſlighting the Directions that are given you for the attaining thereof, and wilfully neglecting and diſregarding the means of Grace. And ſo, after you have lived a poor life here, to be everlaſtingly miſerable hereafter: From a poor Cottage, to go down to a dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to a lake of fire and brimſtone, there to be tormented with the Devil and his Angels for ever. You think (may be) becauſe you are poor, and not book learn'd, that God will require little of you: But do not flatter and delude your ſelves; God will require of you according to the means of Grace he affords you. Though you are ignorant, would not your Miniſter inſtruct you? Or have you no neighbours that you may ask, and learn the way of Salvation from? Do you think you are exempted from ſeeking after knowledg? from Family duties, from a conſcionable &amp; conſtant attendance on the publick Ordinances? Do ye think it will be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient excuſe, when you come to ſtand upon your Trial at Gods Tribunal, to plead, you wanted clothes, and therefore could not come to the publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; when 'tis well known you can dreſſe your ſelves in a tollerably decent manner (at any time) to go to a dinner? There is an abſolute neceſſity you must be inſtructed, and get knowledge in the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:170311:290"/> things that concern your Salvation, or you will die in your ſins. And believe it, you had better die in a ditch, than die in your ſins. Were you ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the great and weighty concernments of your ſoules, you would wreſtle againſt all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſeek after knowledge with all ſeriouſneſs. And if you would ſet your ſelves in good earneſt to it, you might quickly attain much more than you can imagine; you might ſoon grow rich in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Grace: Though you are poor here, you might be heirs of Heaven, and when you die, with</hi> Lazarus, <hi>be received into</hi> Abrahams <hi>boſom. Oh therefore beſtir your ſelves! You labour hard to get a little money here; Oh take ſome pains to get a Kingdom that is offered to you on very fair terms. Labour to be ſenſible of your ſpiritual poverty, of the vileneſſe of your natural condition, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold ſins of your life; Seek for help from Christ, (where help</hi> onely is to he had) <hi>Give up your ſoules to him, and beg of him pardon</hi> and Grace: <hi>Receive him for your Lord, as well as your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; beg his Spirit to ſanctifie you, and be willing to live in obedience to his Laws and Precepts. And if you be once thus united unto him, being rich in Faith and the fruits thereof, you are heirs of the Kingdom, even the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſhall ſhortly enter into your inheritance gloriouſly and triumphantly: Oh therefore though you are poor in this world, yet labour to be ſpiritually rich: Mind not only the preſent, but ſecure your future
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:170311:291"/> ſtate. And not only look to your ſelves, but to your children alſo: Oh let not them be bred up in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and prophanneſſe. One main reaſon of the great blindneſſe and irreligion that is among poor people, is, the cannot read; neither do many of them take any care their children ſhould learn. They had rather they ſhould earn a penny, than ſpend two or three hours in a day to get that skill. If there were a book extant, and ordinarily to be had as the Bible is, which men did generally beleeve to contain a plain and eaſie way for all men to become rich, and to live in health, and pleaſure, and this worlds happineſs, Can it be imagined that the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt people would not learn to read it? or would neglect to ſtudy it? Whatever paines it cost, or difficulties it put them to, be ſure they would not fail herein. How is it then, that ſo many that have the name of Chriſtians, can be content that both themſelves and their children ſhould be unable to read the Scriptures, and ſo commonly remain as ignorant of the things of God, as if they had been born among the</hi> Indians.</p>

               <p>There are many <hi>weighty Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to perſwade them to it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>God now invites them to it,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.1. <hi>Remember now thy Creatour in the daies of thy youth,</hi> &amp;c. And let them conſider, 1. God hath <hi>no need</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> but they have <hi>need</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> and cannot poſſibly be <hi>happy</hi> without him. 2. He is willing to be <hi>reconcil'd</hi> to them, if they will <hi>turn</hi> to him, though for their ſins he might <hi>juſtly
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:170311:294"/> deſtroy</hi> them. 3.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Grace is uncertain.</hi> 'Tis not in <hi>mans power</hi> to have Grace when he will. <hi>The Spirit of God will not alwaies ſtrive with the children of men.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thy joyes and comforts will be the greater.</hi> Thou art a <hi>hinderer</hi> of thy <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> all the while thou art going on in the <hi>way of ſin.</hi> Thou art <hi>feeding</hi> on <hi>Onions,</hi> when thou mightſt have <hi>Manna,</hi> Thou art feeding on <hi>husks</hi> with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when thou mighteſt have the <hi>fatted calf.</hi> What are all the <hi>noiſom pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> to the <hi>peace</hi> of a good Conſcience, the <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of God, the <hi>delights</hi> and <hi>joyes</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt?</p>

               <p>So much of the <hi>Duties</hi> belonging to <hi>Young perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to ſpeak to the <hi>Ancient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>main</hi> and <hi>principal care</hi> of thoſe that <hi>are in years,</hi> ſhould be, to make <hi>all ſtrait and even between God</hi> and <hi>their own ſoules;</hi> to ſecure <hi>their ſtate</hi> in <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>their Title</hi> to Glory. For <hi>their Sun is ſetting, their race is almost run;</hi> Though the <hi>younger may die,</hi> yet the <hi>old muſt die,</hi> and after <hi>death</hi> comes <hi>judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let all <hi>ancient</hi> perſons therefore take <hi>theſe following Particulars</hi> into their <hi>ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. The <hi>caſe</hi> of all <hi>old</hi> people that are <hi>yet</hi> in <hi>an unconverted ſtate,</hi> is very <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>dangerous.</hi> For,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:170311:301"/> 1. <hi>This world, and the contentments thereof are (in a manner) done with them. The evil daies are come upon them, wherein</hi> (they muſt needs ſay) <hi>they have no pleaſure in them.</hi> 2. <hi>Uſually they labour under many weakneſſes and bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:</hi> If they have not the <hi>comfort of a good Conſcience</hi> to ſupport them, and to be the <hi>ſtaffe of their age,</hi> how <hi>exceeding miſerable</hi> muſt they needs be? 3. <hi>If they have lived long under the means of Grace, and continued unconverted till old age, 'tis a hundred to one whether they ever be converted or no.</hi> 'Tis <hi>rare</hi> to hear of <hi>any</hi> that have <hi>gone on</hi> in a <hi>long</hi> courſe of <hi>careleſſeneſs</hi> and <hi>ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and been <hi>habituated</hi> and <hi>hardned</hi> in <hi>ſin,</hi> that in their <hi>old age</hi> have <hi>turned</hi> to God. See the Reaſons before mentioned, <hi>p.</hi> 510. 4. <hi>If they die in their ſins, they will receive a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> The <hi>furnace</hi> will be <hi>hotter</hi> for them than for <hi>young</hi> ſinners. They have <hi>contracted</hi> a <hi>greater debt.</hi> The <hi>heap</hi> of their ſins is <hi>greater:</hi> Certainly it will be more <hi>tolerable</hi> in the day of <hi>judgment</hi> for <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan</hi> who were cut off <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> in their ſins, than for <hi>ſinners</hi> that are <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore</hi> or <hi>fourſcore</hi> years old. If the <hi>Judge</hi> at the <hi>Aſsizes</hi> do meet with an <hi>old theef,</hi> or an <hi>old cut purſe,</hi> that have had <hi>many warnings,</hi> and ſtill go on in their <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> they ſeldom <hi>ſcape.</hi> Let all old <hi>impenitent</hi> ſinners think of this. How may God ſay of <hi>ſuch, Heer's an old covetous, worldly-minded man, an old ſwearer, or
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:170311:302"/> drunkard, an old hater of Godlineſſe, and ſlighter of Religion, an old ignorant, careleſſe wretch, a neglecter of Family-duties, one that ſhould have inſtructed his children and ſervants, and bred them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, but in ſtead thereof, has given them an ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and done me a great deal of diſhonour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have forborn him fourty, fifty, ſixty years: He has often quenched the good motions of my Spirit, my Ambaſſadors could never prevail with him to leave his ſins. Now therefore O ye evil Angels, this day, this week, this year require his ſoul of him, and bring him to judgment.</hi> O how exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſad</hi> is the <hi>caſe</hi> of an <hi>old unconverted</hi> man or woman!</p>
               <p n="2">II. Nothing is more to be <hi>admired at</hi> than that <hi>ancient people</hi> ſhould <hi>go on in their ſins,</hi> not <hi>minding ſpeedily</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> to turn to God. For, 1. <hi>The leaſe of their lives is almost expired, And is it not a ſtrange madneſſe, they ſhould make no proviſion for another world?</hi> 2. <hi>They have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny warnings they must go hence, dim eyes, feeble legs, trembling joynts,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.3. <hi>The Sun and the Light is darkned, the keepers of the houſe tremble, the ſtrong men bow themſelves, the grinders ceaſe,</hi> &amp;c. Their bodily <hi>weakneſſes</hi> warn them they muſt not ftay <hi>long</hi> here. 3. They have <hi>but a little time to watch, and the Bridegroom will come,</hi> and if they <hi>get not Oyl into their lamps</hi> now, they will be <hi>for ever ſhut out.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="527" facs="tcp:170311:302"/>
               <p n="3">III. Though their <hi>condition</hi> be very <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> yet it is not <hi>deſperate,</hi> if they will yet <hi>beſtir themſelves.</hi> For let them conſider theſe <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath declar'd a greater delight in the converſion of ſinners, whether young or old, than in their deſtruction</hi> and damnation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Say unto them, as I live ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, turn ye, turn ye from your evil waies, for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The promiſes of God do ſtand in force,</hi> and <hi>will be made good to repenting returning ſinners whether young or old. True Repentance is never too late, but late repentance is ſeldom true.</hi> All ſorts <hi>of ſins</hi> are <hi>pardonable</hi> to <hi>reall penitents</hi> and <hi>true believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is efficacy and vertue enough in Chriſts blood to cleanſe not only young, but old ſinners from all their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt is willing to accept old ſinners, if they will repent and forſake their ſins, and really turn to him, and cloſe with him on his own terms, being willing to take him not only for their Saviour, but for their Lord and King, and to yield up themſelves in ſincere obedience to him, and to be guided and governed by his Grace and holy Spirit.</hi> Chriſt did not come to <hi>ſave</hi> men, by <hi>bringing</hi> them to <hi>Heaven</hi> in their <hi>ungodlineſſe,</hi> or to <hi>Glory</hi> in their
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:170311:303"/> 
                  <hi>ſins,</hi> but to <hi>deſtroy</hi> their <hi>ſins</hi> that would keep them <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Though <hi>ancient</hi> people, that have <hi>gone on</hi> in a long courſe of <hi>ignorance, careleſsneſs, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> of God, and the <hi>concernments</hi> of their ſouls, ſhould be convinced they are <hi>at preſent</hi> in a <hi>bad</hi> condition, <hi>in an unconverted ſtate,</hi> yet it does not thence follow, they muſt needs <hi>ſo continue,</hi> and <hi>utterly</hi> and <hi>finally deſpair;</hi> but they ſhould <hi>awaken</hi> themſelves, delay no longer, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>ſet</hi> themſelves to <hi>get out</hi> of this <hi>miſerable condition,</hi> while there is a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of eſcaping the <hi>danger</hi> of it. 'Tis no folly to be <hi>wiſe</hi> for their ſouls, to be <hi>wiſe</hi> for Eternity <hi>at laſt.</hi> Therefore let them remember, <hi>now if ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. They ſhould be <hi>exceeding careful</hi> they do not deceive themſelves with <hi>ill grounded hopes</hi> of Heaven, <hi>peeſuming</hi> it will <hi>go well</hi> with them in the <hi>other world,</hi> when they have no <hi>reall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> for ſuch a <hi>confidence. A falſe ungrounded hope is but a dream of a waking man.</hi> If a <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Malefactor</hi> ſhould frame a <hi>pardon</hi> for himſelf in the priſon, and think to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by <hi>that,</hi> would it not prove a <hi>miſerable cheat</hi> put upon himſelf? Does it not concern <hi>every one</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>conſider,</hi> whether the <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs they pretend unto,</hi> be of <hi>Gods granting,</hi> or <hi>their own framing?</hi> whether they have any <hi>warrant,</hi> or <hi>promiſe</hi> from Gods Word that <hi>they ſhall be ſav'd:</hi> Or whether they do only <hi>ſtrongly
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:170311:303"/> preſume it,</hi> without any <hi>ſufficient ground.</hi> Oh what <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>ſandy foundations</hi> do many <hi>build</hi> their <hi>hopes</hi> of Heaven upon? <hi>ſuch as theſe,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Their outward profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and a formal performance of religious duties.</hi> But as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>He is not a Jew, who is one outwardly (who has onely the circumciſion of the fleſh) but he is a Jew, who is one inwardly,</hi> whoſe <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>circumciſed.</hi> So he is a <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> upon whoſe <hi>heart</hi> the <hi>ſaving work of converſion hath paſſ'd; who hath felt the power of Grace upon his ſoul, really turning it unto God.</hi> The <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>broad leaves</hi> of an <hi>outward</hi> profeſſion will nothing <hi>avail,</hi> if the fruits of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al holineſs</hi> and <hi>ſanctification</hi> be wanting. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their moral and civil deportment, their fair and honeſt converſation in the world,</hi> and <hi>freedom from groſſe ſins.</hi> Now though <hi>outward righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> be <hi>not only</hi> exceeding <hi>commendable,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> yet <hi>'tis a dangerous thing to reſt upon;</hi> and <hi>by that only,</hi> we cannot conclude any man to be in a <hi>good ſtate</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> to God ward. For, 1. You ſhall find it <hi>many times</hi> accompanied with <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>very little ſavoury knowledge</hi> of God, and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things. 2. Such perſons <hi>uſually</hi> ſee <hi>no neceſſity of regeneration,</hi> and the <hi>new birth;</hi> but content
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:170311:304"/> themſelves with a <hi>meer moral change</hi> and <hi>freedom from groſs ſins,</hi> and the <hi>practiſe</hi> of ſome <hi>morall vertues;</hi> no <hi>new nature</hi> being wrought in them, but the <hi>old nature</hi> only <hi>varniſhed over</hi> with <hi>civil</hi> education. 3. There you ſhall not find <hi>for the moſt part</hi> any <hi>great prizing</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get an intereſt in him;</hi> and yet if the <hi>ſoul</hi> be not <hi>really united</hi> to him, no <hi>juſtification ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> or <hi>ſalvation</hi> can be expected. 4. The <hi>chief care</hi> is uſually about an <hi>outward fairneſſe,</hi> and <hi>unblameableneſs</hi> of converſation; <hi>little care</hi> about <hi>mortification</hi> of <hi>inward luſts,</hi> &amp; <hi>right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the affections.</hi> True <hi>Grace</hi> preſſeth upon us <hi>heart-duties,</hi> as well as <hi>externall obedience,</hi> &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>heart-ſins,</hi> as well as <hi>outward filthineſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature; old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.</hi> 5. <hi>The Glory of God is not the chief aim and end,</hi> as it ſhould be in whatever we do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> 6. There is <hi>uſually</hi> a <hi>greater care</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> then of the <hi>first.</hi> You ſhall have <hi>ſome men</hi> very <hi>juſt</hi> in their <hi>dealings, good neighbours,</hi> and of a <hi>commendable converſation</hi> as to the world, who yet (may be) are <hi>very negligent</hi> and <hi>careleſſe of Gods Worſhip, of Family duties, of the Lords day,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, many times are <hi>profeſſed haters</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> to the <hi>practical power</hi> of Godlineſſe: So that we ſee
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:170311:304"/> more is requir'd than <hi>meer civility,</hi> and an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, moral uprightneſs</hi> to <hi>ground</hi> a <hi>hope</hi> of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon. <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, <hi>was concerning the righteouſneſſe of the Law blameleſs, Phil.</hi> 3.6. Yet when God had <hi>ſavingly enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> his ſoul, what a <hi>doom</hi> doth he <hi>paſs</hi> upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? and cals his <hi>ſelf righteouſneſſe dung,</hi> which he accounted <hi>Gold</hi> before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Some reformation that is wrought in them.</hi> They have <hi>left ſome ſins</hi> they were formerly <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to. But 'tis not only the <hi>forbearing</hi> of <hi>ſome ſins,</hi> but an <hi>inward loathing, hating, abhorring,</hi> and <hi>forſaking all known ſins,</hi> that is a <hi>good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of a <hi>gracious ſtate.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>care</hi> to <hi>mortifie inward luſts,</hi> and the <hi>corruptions</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> as well as to <hi>abſtain</hi> from <hi>outward acts of ſin.</hi> To <hi>mortifie our ſins,</hi> is a <hi>Sacrifice well-pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to God: In a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> theſe <hi>two things</hi> were requir'd. 1. <hi>That it ſhould be ſlain, not die of it ſelf:</hi> If <hi>thy luſts</hi> and <hi>ſins</hi> rather <hi>leave</hi> thee, than <hi>thou</hi> them; or <hi>abate</hi> and <hi>die</hi> meerly <hi>through age,</hi> or the decay of <hi>natural vigour,</hi> this <hi>change</hi> is wrought in thee, not by <hi>Grace,</hi> but by <hi>age.</hi> 2. <hi>A Sacrifice was to be offered to God.</hi> If thou do leave thy <hi>former ſins,</hi> and <hi>do it not</hi> out of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to God, but for thy <hi>credit ſake,</hi> or <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>ſome temporal advantage,</hi> this is not the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> God delights in.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The good opinion others have of them.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think them <hi>good Chriſtians;</hi> why ſhould
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:170311:305"/> not they <hi>think ſo</hi> of themſelves? But let them <hi>conſider,</hi> that which is a <hi>ſufficient ground</hi> for <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi> to think <hi>well</hi> of us, is not a <hi>ſufficient ground</hi> for <hi>us</hi> to think <hi>well</hi> of <hi>our ſelves.</hi> A <hi>fair, outward deportment, free from ſcandal</hi> and <hi>offence,</hi> is a <hi>ſufficient ground</hi> for <hi>another</hi> to think <hi>well</hi> of us; but we muſt feel ſome <hi>inward ſaving work</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> upon our hearts, before we judge our <hi>own condition</hi> to be good.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Comparing themſelves with others, they find they are not ſo bad as many others.</hi> But 'tis <hi>no ſecurity</hi> to any mans ſoul to <hi>be better than others,</hi> except <hi>thoſe others</hi> be in a <hi>ſafe condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The untroubledneſſe of their Conſciences.</hi> All <hi>untroubledneſs</hi> of Conſcience is not an <hi>Argument</hi> of a <hi>ſafe</hi> condition. Some <hi>peace</hi> of Conſcience <hi>ariſes</hi> from <hi>ignorance, ſecurity, ſleepineſſe, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> 'Tis <hi>one</hi> of Gods <hi>greateſt judgments</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a man an <hi>untroubled Conſcience</hi> in a <hi>ſinfull courſe.</hi> To be like <hi>Jonah, ready to be drown'd, and yet faſt aſleep.</hi> But now the <hi>peace of a good Conſcience</hi> uſually followes upon <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>ſorrow for ſin,</hi> and <hi>cloſing with Christ,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the ſoul up to him for pardon and Grace.</hi> Such a <hi>Conſcience</hi> does not only <hi>not accuſe</hi> (as the <hi>ſlumbring Conſcience of a wicked man may do</hi>) but <hi>acquits,</hi> and <hi>diſcharges,</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> upon <hi>Goſpel</hi> grounds.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>They thrive and proſper well in the world.</hi> So they may, and yet <hi>have all their portion in

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>God is merciful and ready to pardon.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> is <hi>a merciful King, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> But upon <hi>what terms</hi> hath he promiſed <hi>pardon</hi> to ſinners? for <hi>our hope</hi> of pardon muſt have ſome <hi>promiſe</hi> in the <hi>Word</hi> for its <hi>bottom</hi> and <hi>foundation,</hi> or elſe we do but <hi>meerly delude</hi> our ſelves.

But alas! how <hi>miſerably</hi> do many <hi>delude themſelves</hi> both in the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith?</hi> never rightly underſtanding what a <hi>repenting frame of heart</hi> means, nor what it is <hi>ſavingly to beleeve in Chriſt.</hi> I deſire them therefore to read over <hi>once</hi> and <hi>again</hi> thoſe <hi>two Chapters</hi> concerning <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> (which are the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> in this part of the Treatiſe) and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves thereby; that ſo they may not

               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Ancient</hi> perſons ſhould <hi>redeem the time</hi> that yet remaines unto them, <hi>for the working out of their ſalvation.</hi> They have but a <hi>little while</hi> to <hi>ſtay here,</hi> and they have a <hi>great deal of work to do,</hi> to <hi>retract</hi> the <hi>ſins</hi> of a long life, and to <hi>ſecure their interest in Christ.</hi> They ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with a little <hi>formal devotion</hi> and the performance of ſome <hi>few religious duties,</hi> as too many old people are apt to do.

                  <p>ONE of the <hi>main</hi> buſineſſes of our <hi>life</hi> ſhould be to <hi>prepare</hi> for <hi>death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order hereunto obſerve theſe <hi>directions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Meditate <hi>often</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> on thy <hi>death</hi> and <hi>diſsolution</hi> even in time of thy <hi>health. Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> made his Sepulchre in his <hi>garden,</hi> that in the midſt of his delights he might think of death. Often <hi>retire,</hi> and <hi>take thy ſelf alone,</hi> and walk <hi>in the valley of the ſhadow of death.</hi> Do not <hi>ſtart</hi> from the <hi>thoughts</hi> of it. Do by thy <hi>ſoul,</hi> when thou findeſt it <hi>ſhy</hi> of ſuch <hi>meditations,</hi> as we do by our <hi>horſes,</hi> that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>boggle</hi> and <hi>ſtart</hi> when we ride them, when they <hi>fly back,</hi> and <hi>ſtart</hi> at a <hi>thing</hi> in the way, we do not yield to their <hi>fear,</hi> and go back (that will make them worſe another time) but we ride them up <hi>cloſe</hi> to <hi>that</hi> they are afraid of, and ſo in time <hi>break</hi> them of that ill quality. So do thou, bring up thy <hi>heart,</hi> and inure it to look upon death, and to handle that <hi>Serpent.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:170311:328"/> death is making its approaches to thee, and may be upon thee before thou art aware. O therefore, prepare for it, that when it comes, and attaches thee, thou maiſt be found in ſuch <hi>a gracious ſtate, with ſuch a frame of Spirit,</hi> and <hi>walking in ſuch a holy way of life</hi> that thou maiſt bid it <hi>welcom,</hi> and be able to ſay with bleſſed <hi>Paul, I deſire to be diſsolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>frequent meditation of death</hi> will be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To quicken thy ſoul to a deep humiliation and repentance for thy past ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To repreſſe the eager and inſatiable deſire of riches, and the love of this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To antidote thee againſt ſin for time to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>To make thee improve time, and carefully to work out thy ſalvation.</hi> Think often of death, and it will keep worſe company from thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Labour to take away from <hi>thy own death</hi> the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> thereof, The <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> ſeeing <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſo exceeding <hi>ſtrong,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to know <hi>wherein</hi> his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> principally <hi>conſiſted;</hi> and when they underſtood it to lie in the <hi>hair of his head,</hi> they ceaſed not till it was cut. Conſider therefore, wherein the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of death lies: The Spirit of God teacheth us <hi>that,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. <hi>The ſting of death is ſin.</hi> The <hi>power</hi> and <hi>force</hi> and <hi>ſting</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:170311:328"/> mans <hi>particular death</hi> lies in his <hi>own ſins. Death</hi> cannot hurt us, but by the <hi>force</hi> of <hi>our own ſins.</hi> A man may ſafely handle a Serpent when the ſting is out. If death be diſarmed of its ſting and poyſon, it cannot hurt us. It concerns us therefore to <hi>uſe effectual means</hi> that our ſins may be <hi>removed</hi> and <hi>pardoned,</hi> and to labour before <hi>we die,</hi> to aboliſh the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of death. Now the way to <hi>do this</hi> is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>humble our ſouls unfeignedly before the Lord, and to repent of all our ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>fly to Chriſt and to cloſe with him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In <hi>the ſtrength of his Grace to amend our lives,</hi> and to walk in the waies of holineſſe. The <hi>ſting</hi> of <hi>death</hi> is taken away by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> as to all <hi>real converts,</hi> and <hi>true believers,</hi> ſo that it cannot <hi>hurt</hi> them, nay, will be an <hi>advantage</hi> to them: It will be only a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>ſhort</hi> paſſage to a glorious Palace, to the bliſſeful manſions above. So that they may triumph as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth us victory through our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> But now to all <hi>impenitent, unpardoned</hi> ſinners, how <hi>deadly,</hi> how <hi>incurable</hi> is the <hi>ſting</hi> of death? Death is death <hi>with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>Hell into the bargain</hi> to them that <hi>die in their ſins.</hi> No ſight in the world more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than to ſee a <hi>dying ſinner</hi> (with his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>newly awakened</hi>) conflicting with <hi>death,</hi>
                     <pb n="580" facs="tcp:170311:329"/> and <hi>ſin,</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> and Gods <hi>Curſe</hi> together. O how <hi>ſad,</hi> how <hi>intollerably ſad</hi> is it to ſee a man that hath gone on in a <hi>long, careleſſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate</hi> courſe of ſinning, now at the <hi>point of death</hi> to have his eies <hi>firſt opened,</hi> and to ſee himſelf on the brink of the <hi>dreadful pit,</hi> unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably falling into the <hi>lake of fire and brimſtone.</hi> To <hi>ſuch</hi> a perſon, death brings its <hi>poyſoned arrow,</hi> and <hi>executes</hi> him with its <hi>venemous ſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Give all diligence</hi> in this life, to <hi>lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. That is, to <hi>enter into the firſt degree of life eternal.</hi> Eternal life may be look'd upon under <hi>three conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> As <hi>Initial,</hi> as <hi>Partial,</hi> as <hi>Perfectional:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>eternal life initial</hi> is that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this life, and is an <hi>earneſt</hi> of that which is to follow. 'Tis the <hi>life of Grace:</hi> Of this our Saviour ſpake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, he that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life.</hi> —</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Partial life eternal</hi> is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth (though to the <hi>nobler</hi>) yet but to a <hi>part</hi> of man, namely, to the Soul. The happineſſe which the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> enjoy between the <hi>time of their death,</hi> and the <hi>laſt day,</hi> is the <hi>partial life eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Perfectional life eternal</hi> is that which
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:170311:329"/> ſhall be conferred on the <hi>Saints immediatly</hi> after the bleſſed <hi>reunion of their ſouls</hi> and <hi>bodies,</hi> and that <hi>gracious ſentence</hi> pronounc'd, <hi>come ye bleſſed of my Father, receive the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> So that we ſee we muſt in <hi>this world</hi> enter into the <hi>first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of eternal life, if ever we intend to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the <hi>other two.</hi> We muſt be raiſed from the death of ſin to the life of grace. We muſt as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Be delivered from the power of darkneſſe, and tranſlated into the Kingdom</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour. We muſt with <hi>Paul</hi> be able to ſay, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, i. e. By his Spirit guides</hi> and <hi>governs my will, affections,</hi> and <hi>all the powers both of my ſoul</hi> and <hi>body.</hi> Whoever would be <hi>ſaved</hi> when he is <hi>dead,</hi> muſt <hi>begin</hi> to be <hi>ſaved</hi> while he is <hi>living.</hi> We muſt <hi>begin</hi> to live that <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi> before we die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Inure thy ſelf to <hi>die to this world</hi> and the <hi>enjoyments</hi> of it, every day, <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more. Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>he died daily,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. If we would learn to <hi>do ſo,</hi> it would not be ſo <hi>hard</hi> to <hi>die,</hi> when we come to it <hi>in good earneſt.</hi> Death is not ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> to him whoſe natural ſtrength has been waſted with a <hi>long, pining</hi> ſickneſſe, as to him who lies but a <hi>few daies</hi> ſick, and has <hi>ſtrength</hi> of nature to make reſiſtance. <hi>That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> whoſe <hi>love</hi> to his life, and the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:170311:330"/> of it, hath been for many years <hi>conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> and <hi>dying,</hi> will more eaſily part with them, than <hi>he</hi> whoſe <hi>love</hi> is <hi>ſtronger</hi> to them; As the <hi>Reverend</hi> Mr. <hi>Gurnal</hi> excellently expreſſes it in his <hi>Chriſtian Armour.</hi> We ſhould conſider, we are but <hi>pilgrims</hi> and <hi>ſtrangers</hi> here: <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>proper countrey</hi> of holy Souls. We ſhould therefore be providing for our <hi>removal</hi> out of this <hi>ſtrange countrey.</hi> We ſhould <hi>pack up,</hi> and ſend our <hi>beſt things</hi> aforehand, namely, <hi>our love, our hearts, our delights, our joyes,</hi> before we <hi>ſet out</hi> our ſelves for <hi>thoſe Heavenly manſions.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider what <hi>great reaſons</hi> there are, that thoſe that are <hi>truly Godly</hi> ſhould not much <hi>fear</hi> death. I confeſſe nothing can <hi>ſweeten</hi> death, and make it <hi>deſirable</hi> to a Chriſtian, but <hi>only an intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> Things that are in their own nature <hi>ſour</hi> and <hi>ſharp,</hi> will ask much <hi>Sugar</hi> to make them ſweet. Death is one of thoſe things, that hath the moſt <hi>harſh,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful</hi> taſt to a creatures pallat that may be. Believe it, a man cannot think <hi>(with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort)</hi> of putting his <hi>head</hi> into another world, if he hath no <hi>ſolid ground</hi> to hope <hi>Christ</hi> will <hi>own</hi> him there for <hi>his.</hi> But if he <hi>have,</hi> there are <hi>many reaſons,</hi> why he ſhould not <hi>dread</hi> death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They that are <hi>truly godly,</hi> ſhall <hi>die but once, i. e.</hi> a <hi>natural death</hi> only: The wicked <hi>die twice,</hi> not only a <hi>natural,</hi> but a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> death. The <hi>natural</hi> death ſtands in the <hi>ſeparation of the ſoul
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:170311:330"/> from the body.</hi> The <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> in the <hi>ſeparation of ſoul and body from God,</hi> Rev. 20 6. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the first reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power.</hi> He that is <hi>born</hi> but <hi>once,</hi> (namely <hi>naturally</hi>) ſhall <hi>die twice, naturally</hi> and <hi>ſpiritually:</hi> He that is <hi>born twice, i. e.</hi> beſides his <hi>natural birth,</hi> hath been <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally regenerated</hi> and <hi>born again,</hi> ſhall <hi>die but once,</hi> namely, a <hi>natural death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Death is not a <hi>deſtruction,</hi> or <hi>annihilation</hi> either of <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>body,</hi> but only an <hi>alteration</hi> and <hi>change</hi> of the condition of <hi>them both,</hi> and that for the <hi>better</hi> to all thoſe that have an intereſt in Chriſt. Such may ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1.21. <hi>To me to live is Christ, to die is gain.</hi> For, 1. <hi>Though death ſeparate ſoul and body, yet it can ſeparate neither of them from Christ.</hi> As in Chriſt's death, his <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> were ſeparated <hi>each</hi> from <hi>other,</hi> yet <hi>neither</hi> of them from the <hi>ſecond Perſon in the Trinity,</hi> in which <hi>both</hi> of them did ſubſiſt at that time in the <hi>perſonal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> ſo though when the Saints die, <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be ſeparated;</hi> yet after this ſeparation, <hi>both</hi> remain <hi>united to Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>myſtical Union;</hi> becauſe their <hi>bodies</hi> as well as their <hi>ſouls</hi> are <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>myſtical</hi> body of Chriſt, <hi>who is the Head</hi> and <hi>Saviour of the whole perſon,</hi> conſiſting of ſoul and body. <hi>And when Chriſt who is their life ſhall appear, then ſhall they alſo appear with him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3.3, 4. We ſee then that
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:170311:331"/> though body and ſoul be ſever'd <hi>each from other</hi> at death, yet (as to all thoſe that <hi>die in the Lord) neither</hi> of them are <hi>ſevered</hi> or <hi>disjoyned</hi> from Chriſt; but the <hi>conjunction</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in this life, <hi>remaines for ever:</hi> Which muſt needs be matter of <hi>exceeding joy</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> to them that by a <hi>lively Faith</hi> are <hi>united to him</hi> here. 2. <hi>The body being reſolved into duſt, is freed from all ſickneſſe,</hi> and <hi>pains, from all the miſeries, troubles</hi> and <hi>calamities of this life.</hi> 3. <hi>It ceaſeth to be, either an active, or a paſſive inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin; whereas in this life 'tis both.</hi> Sin, and the temptations to it, are the great grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and burdens of the ſervants of God, which they groan to be delivered from. As <hi>ſin</hi> therefore brought <hi>death</hi> into our bodies, ſo <hi>death</hi> carries <hi>ſin</hi> out of them. 4. <hi>The bodies of the Saints ſhall be raiſed in a far greater glory at the general reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>be joyned again to their ſouls, to live an everlaſting life of</hi> glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe with them.</p>
                  <p>So that we may from hence conclude <hi>the body will be no loſer</hi> by this change. Neither will the <hi>ſoul;</hi> for it will gain <hi>this threefold advantage</hi> thereby,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It will change its place, and be remov'd from a priſon to a palace, from a Tabernacle of clay, to a Heavenly Manſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Its qualities.</hi> Here 'tis infeſted with <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>unruly paſſions</hi> and <hi>affections of all ſorts,</hi>
                     <pb n="585" facs="tcp:170311:331"/> which are a great annoyment to it: But there it ſhall be <hi>freed from all theſe,</hi> and made perfectly holy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Its company.</hi> It leaves the <hi>company</hi> of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and gaines the <hi>company</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> Yea, ſhall have <hi>fellowſhip with the bleſſed Trinity, in whoſe preſence there is fulneſſe of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 16.11. Let all ſuch therefore as have an <hi>intereſt in Chriſt</hi> look upon <hi>death,</hi> not <hi>in the glaſs of the Law,</hi> but <hi>of the Goſpel. Death</hi> in the <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>curſe,</hi> and a <hi>downfal to the pit of deſtruction.</hi> In the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it is an <hi>entrance into Heaven.</hi> Chriſt hath taken away the <hi>ſting</hi> and <hi>miſchief,</hi> and <hi>deſtructive power of death.</hi> He hath <hi>altered the property of it,</hi> and in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>door</hi> to <hi>Hell,</hi> hath made it a <hi>gate</hi> to <hi>bliſſe</hi> and <hi>happineſſe</hi> for <hi>all thoſe that are his.</hi> Let the <hi>truly Godly</hi> and <hi>ſerious Chriſtian</hi> therefore, not fix his mind ſo much on the <hi>pangs</hi> and <hi>torments</hi> of death, as upon the <hi>bleſsed eſtate,</hi> that is to be enjoyed after it, and ſo fortifie his heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fear of it.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>What the Conſequents of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſeems to hold forth unto us a <hi>twofold judgment</hi> to come.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Particular,</hi> which <hi>followes immediatly after death.</hi> Thus is that underſtood, <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth, as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it, i. e.</hi> to be <hi>judged by him,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi> doth well explain it.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>General, at the end of the world.</hi> The certainty of which may appear to us from theſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the <hi>voice of natural Conſcience,</hi> which is very <hi>ſenſible</hi> of it. <hi>Foelix</hi> trembled, when <hi>Paul</hi> preached of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. And when he diſcourſed to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> thoſe great <hi>Lights</hi> of the <hi>Gentile</hi> world, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.31. That <hi>God hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead;</hi> found <hi>ſome</hi> who <hi>mocked</hi> when they heard of the <hi>reſurrection of the dead;</hi> but againſt the
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:170311:333"/> 
                     <hi>day of judgment</hi> none replied. So <hi>true it is</hi> which the <hi>ſame Apoſtle</hi> elſewhere ſaies of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had but the <hi>light of Nature</hi> (and ſo a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience) that they ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their Conſciences al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or excuſing one another,</hi> Rom. 2.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> which requires it. God being the <hi>Judge</hi> of the world, as well as the <hi>Creator,</hi> we may infallibly conclude <hi>he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe.</hi> But as the affairs of this preſent life are ordered (though they lie under the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi>) yet they ſhew <hi>no ſign</hi> of an <hi>univerſal Juſtice.</hi> Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>wicked flouriſh</hi> and <hi>proſper,</hi> while the <hi>righteous</hi> are <hi>afflicted</hi> and <hi>in miſery.</hi> In this life nothing more certain, than that <hi>rewards</hi> are not <hi>correſpondent</hi> to the <hi>vertues,</hi> nor <hi>puniſhments proportionable</hi> to the <hi>ſins</hi> of men. If therefore there be a <hi>Judge</hi> of the world (and <hi>that judge be juſt</hi>) there is a <hi>judgment</hi> to <hi>come</hi> in another world, and the <hi>effects thereof</hi> concern <hi>another life.</hi> In that day <hi>there will be a revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2.5. God will then ſhew a <hi>perfect demonſtration of his Juſtice,</hi> and men ſhall diſcern <hi>between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God and him that ſerveth him not,</hi> Mal. 3.18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the <hi>clear and manifeſt declaration of
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:170311:334"/> the will of God.</hi> We have an expreſſe <hi>manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods will</hi> and purpoſe concerning a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. <hi>For God ſhall bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> Acts 17.30. <hi>But now God commandeth all men every where to repent.</hi> V. 31. <hi>Becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> No <hi>Doctrine</hi> more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> in the Word of God, than that of <hi>Eternal judgment, Heb</hi> 6.2. Wherein the <hi>Judge</hi> will ſentence to <hi>an eternall ſtate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. From a <hi>repreſentation of it</hi> to the <hi>eies</hi> of ſome of Gods ſervants in <hi>Divine viſions.</hi> As to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7.9. <hi>I beheld till the Thrones were caſt down, and the Ancient of daies did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool; his Throne was like the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flame, and his wheels as burning fire,</hi> V. 10. <hi>A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him: Thouſand Thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him: The judgment was ſet and the books were opened.</hi> And likewiſe to St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead ſmall and great ſtand before God, and the books were opened; and another book was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of thoſe things, which were written in the books, according to their works.</hi> The <hi>Throne</hi>
                     <pb n="591" facs="tcp:170311:334"/> therefore hath been already <hi>ſeen;</hi> the <hi>Judge</hi> hath appeared ſitting on it; the <hi>Books</hi> have been already opened; the <hi>dead, ſmall</hi> and <hi>great</hi> have been ſeen, ſtanding before him. The <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> of it to the <hi>eye,</hi> in thoſe Divine viſions, is a farther aſſurance of the <hi>certainty</hi> of it, than if it had only been <hi>foretold,</hi> and ſo <hi>repreſented</hi> to the ear.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then there will be a day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>There will be a perſonal appearance of all men before that ſeat of judicature, upon which Chriſt ſhall ſit.</hi> For we muſt <hi>all appear,</hi> and we ſhall all <hi>ſtand</hi> before that judgment-ſeat, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead ſmall and great ſtand before God,</hi> &amp;c.

Thoſe that have been relieved by us, ſhall welcome us into Heaven, <hi>who therefore are ſaid</hi> (according to ſome Interpreters) to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into everlaſting habitations, Luke</hi> 16.9. Yea, we ſhall know <hi>thoſe</hi> whom we <hi>never ſaw.</hi> Why elſe is it made a <hi>part of our priviledge to ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob?</hi> Mat. 8.11. In the transfiguration, <hi>Peter</hi> knew <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> dead many hundred years before. So ſhall we (as 'tis more than probable) know one another. O what bleſſed company ſhall we converſe with in the City that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And Laſtly, <hi>The Saints in Heaven ſhall be bleſſed in this, They ſhall have the perpetual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all this bleſsedneſſe ſecured to them, without any fear of ever loſing it, or being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:170311:354"/> of it.</hi> The <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall never <hi>put off</hi> their glorious robes, after they have once <hi>put them on.</hi> Their ſtate is a <hi>ſure eternal ſtate</hi> of actual delights. Though there be <hi>ſeveral degrees</hi> of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven, yet he that enjoyes the <hi>leaſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is <hi>fully</hi> ſatisfied with what he enjoyes. He deſires not one degree of Glory above what he poſſeſſes.</p>
                  <p>What now remaines, but that we <hi>preſſe this duty</hi> upon our ſelves, <hi>frequently to meditate on this coeleſtial Glory.</hi> Many great benefits will accrue to us thereby.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This will abate our thirſt after earthly things.</hi> One houres <hi>ſerious muſing</hi> on the glory that is above, would cauſe the ſoul to be as a <hi>weaned child</hi> to the glory that is here below.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will make ſufferings light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>For I reckon</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It will make us ſerious in Duties.</hi> It will make us <hi>pray earneſtly, hear attentively, walk circumſpectly.</hi> Serious thoughts of Heaven will make us ſhake off <hi>lazineſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſloth,</hi> and with <hi>fervency of Spirit</hi> to ſerve the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It will ſtirre us up to an earneſt <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>that righteouſneſſe</hi> to which ſuch a Glory apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and to a <hi>careful</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> performance of <hi>thoſe commands</hi> to which ſuch a <hi>reward</hi> is ſo
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:170311:355"/> graciouſly promiſed. <hi>Without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Men do but deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who think to paſſe immediatly from a <hi>ſtate of corruption,</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>Glory.</hi> Would we enter into Glory, let us labour to <hi>ſecure our ſtate</hi> in Grace. Grace and Glory do not differ <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> but <hi>gradually.</hi> When a ſoul is brought into a <hi>ſtate of ſaving Grace,</hi> it is entred into a <hi>ſtate of Glory:</hi> For as God hath prepared <hi>Heaven for his children,</hi> ſo he prepares <hi>his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for Heaven.</hi> Grace is the <hi>Nurſery</hi> of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: As the <hi>plants of righteouſneſs</hi> grow fit for <hi>Heaven,</hi> they are <hi>removed</hi> to Heaven, and ſhall be <hi>for ever with the Lord. O Lord, prepare and fit my ſoul for this new Jeruſalem, into which no unclean thing can enter. Give me true repentance for all my ſins, and waſh away the guilt of them in the blood of thy dear Son, my Lord and Saviour: Sanctifie me throughout both in ſoul and body by thy Grace and holy Spirit, and enable me to glorifie thee in this life, that I may hereafter enter into thy Kingdom, into that eternal ſtate of Glory, bliſs, and purity. O let me not have my portion in this life, but when thou ſendeſt for me out of this world by death, Lord receive my ſoul (for thy free mercy and my Saviours merits ſake) into thoſe Heavenly manſions, where there is fulneſſe of joy, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures at thy right hand for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
